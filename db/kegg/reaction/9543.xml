NAME        S-adenosyl-L-methionine:malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] O-methyltransferase
DEFINITION  S-Adenosyl-L-methionine + Malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] <=> S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine + Malonyl-[acp] methyl ester
EQUATION    C00019 + C01209 <=> C00021 + C19673
COMMENT     Malonyl-[acp] is a far better acceptor of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine than was malonyl-CoA.
