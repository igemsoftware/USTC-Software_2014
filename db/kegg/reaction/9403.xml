ENTRY       R09403                      Reaction
NAME        L-isoleucine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating)
DEFINITION  L-Isoleucine + 2 Oxygen + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ <=> (E)-2-Methylbutanal oxime + 2 NADP+ + CO2 + 3 H2O
EQUATION    C00407 + 2 C00007 + 2 C00005 + 2 C00080 <=> C19491 + 2 C00006 + C00011 + 3 C00001
COMMENT     three-step reaction (see R10027+R10028+R10029)
            The enzyme can also accept L-valine as substrate, with a lower activity.(1.14.13.118)
            3step reaction (similar to R00730+R04460+R07190)
