ENTRY       R08663                      Reaction
NAME        L-valine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating, decarboxylating)
DEFINITION  L-Valine + 2 Oxygen + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ <=> (E)-2-Methylpropanal oxime + 3 H2O + 2 NADP+ + CO2
EQUATION    C00183 + 2 C00007 + 2 C00005 + 2 C00080 <=> C03219 + 3 C00001 + 2 C00006 + C00011
COMMENT     three-step reaction (see R10031+R10032+R10033)
            The enzyme can also accept L-isoleucine as substrate, with a lower activity.(1.14.13.117)
            3step reaction (similar to R00730+R04460+R07190)
