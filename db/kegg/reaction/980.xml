NAME        Anthranilate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating, deaminating)
DEFINITION  Anthranilate + Oxygen + NADPH + H+ <=> 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate + Ammonia + NADP+
EQUATION    C00108 + C00007 + C00005 + C00080 <=> C00196 + C00014 + C00006
COMMENT     the oxygen atom at the 3-position of the product, 2,3-
            dihydroxybenzoate, originates from O2, while that at the 2-position 
            is derived from H2O.
