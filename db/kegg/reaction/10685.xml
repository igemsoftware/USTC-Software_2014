ENTRY       R10685                      Reaction
DEFINITION  NAD+ + Glycine + Sulfur donor <=> ADP-5-ethyl-4-methylthiazole-2-carboxylate + Nicotinamide + 3 H2O
EQUATION    C00003 + C00037 + C17023 <=> C20784 + C00153 + 3 C00001
COMMENT     thiamine thiazole synthase
            multi-step reaction
            Sulfur donor is enzyme itself (one cystein residue looses H2S to form dehydroalanie residue)
