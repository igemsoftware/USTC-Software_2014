NAME        Parathion,reduced-flavoprotein:oxygen oxidoreductase
DEFINITION  Parathion + Reduced flavoprotein + Oxygen <=> Paraoxon + Oxidized flavoprotein + Sulfur + H2O
EQUATION    C06604 + C03024 + C00007 <=> C06606 + C03161 + C00087 + C00001
COMMENT     P-450 reductase is the flavoprotein and re-reduced by NADPH (see R08551)
            The product sulfur is reactive (e.g. forming hydrodisulfide with cysteine residue)
