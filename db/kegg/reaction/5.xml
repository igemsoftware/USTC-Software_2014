ENTRY       R00005                      Reaction
NAME        urea-1-carboxylate amidohydrolase
DEFINITION  Urea-1-carboxylate + H2O <=> 2 CO2 + 2 Ammonia
EQUATION    C01010 + C00001 <=> 2 C00011 + 2 C00014
COMMENT     The yeast enzyme (but not that from green algae) also catalyses the 
            reaction of EC 6.3.4.6 urea carboxylase, thus bringing about the 
            hydrolysis of urea to CO2 and NH3 in the presence of ATP and 
            bicarbonate.
            R00774 (6.3.4.6)
