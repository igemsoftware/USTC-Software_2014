ENTRY       R00241                      Reaction
NAME        ATP:L-glutamate 1-phosphotransferase
DEFINITION  ATP + L-Glutamate <=> ADP + L-Glutamyl 1-phosphate
EQUATION    C00002 + C00025 <=> C00008 + C05765
COMMENT     possibly erroneous
            This reaction was proposed to be involved in the conversion of L-glutamate to 5-aminolevulinate, but the conversion was revised to R05578+R04109+R02272.
