ENTRY       R01348                      Reaction
NAME        Fatty acid,reduced-flavoprotein:oxygen oxidoreductase (omega-hydroxylating)
DEFINITION  Fatty acid + Oxygen + Reduced flavoprotein <=> omega-Hydroxy fatty acid + Oxidized flavoprotein + H2O
EQUATION    C00162 + C00007 + C03024 <=> C03547 + C03161 + C00001
COMMENT     P-450 reductase (ec 1.6.2.4) is the flavoprotein and re-reduced by NADPH (see R08551)
            this enzyme must be classified as ec 1.14.14.1 (requiring flavoprotein, not rubredoxin)
