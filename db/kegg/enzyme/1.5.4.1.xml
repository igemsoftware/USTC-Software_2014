NAME        pyrimidodiazepine synthase;
            PDA synthase;
            pyrimidodiazepine:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase (ring-opening, cyclizing)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With a disulfide as acceptor
SYSNAME     pyrimidodiazepine:glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase (ring-opening, cyclizing)
REACTION    a pyrimidodiazepine + glutathione disulfide + H2O = 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin + 2 glutathione [RN:R03984]
ALL_REAC    R03984
SUBSTRATE   pyrimidodiazepine [CPD:C02587];
            glutathione disulfide [CPD:C00127];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin [CPD:C03684];
            glutathione [CPD:C00051]
COMMENT     In the reverse direction of reaction, the reduction of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin is accompanied by the opening of the 6-membered pyrazine ring and the formation of the 7-membered diazepine ring. The pyrimidodiazepine involved is an acetyldihydro derivative. Involved in the formation of the eye pigment drosopterin in Drosophila melanogaster.
