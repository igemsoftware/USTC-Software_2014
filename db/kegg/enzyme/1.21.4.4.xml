ENTRY       EC 1.21.4.4                 Enzyme
NAME        betaine reductase;
            acetyl-phosphate trimethylamine:thioredoxin disulfide oxidoreductase (N,N,N-trimethylglycine-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond;
            With a disulfide as acceptor
SYSNAME     acetyl-phosphate trimethylamine:thioredoxin disulfide oxidoreductase (betaine-forming)
REACTION    acetyl phosphate + trimethylamine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O = betaine + phosphate + thioredoxin [RN:R07228]
ALL_REAC    R07228
SUBSTRATE   acetyl phosphate [CPD:C00227];
            trimethylamine [CPD:C00565];
            thioredoxin disulfide [CPD:C00343];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     betaine [CPD:C00719];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            thioredoxin [CPD:C00342]
COMMENT     The reaction is observed only in the direction of betaine reduction. The enzyme from Eubacterium acidaminophilum consists of subunits A, B and C. Subunit B contains selenocysteine and a pyruvoyl group, and is responsible for betaine binding and trimethylamine release. Subunit A, which also contains selenocysteine, is reduced by thioredoxin, and is needed to convert the carboxymethyl group into a ketene equivalent, in turn used by subunit C to produce acetyl phosphate. Only subunit B distinguishes this enzyme from EC 1.21.4.2 (glycine reductase) and EC 1.21.4.3 (sarcosine reductase).
