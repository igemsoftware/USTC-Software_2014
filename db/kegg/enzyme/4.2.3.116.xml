ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.116                Enzyme
NAME        (+)-camphene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing, (+)-camphene-forming]
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate = (+)-camphene + diphosphate [RN:R09971]
ALL_REAC    R09971
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341]
PRODUCT     (+)-camphene [CPD:C06304];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Cyclase I of Salvia officinalis (sage) gives about equal parts (+)-camphene and (+)-alpha-pinene. (3R)-Linalyl diphosphate can also be used by the enzyme in preference to (3S)-linalyl diphosphate. Requires Mg2+ (preferred to Mn2+). See also EC 4.2.3.121 (+)-alpha-pinene synthase.
