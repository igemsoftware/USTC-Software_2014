ENTRY       EC 1.3.8.5                  Enzyme
NAME        2-methyl-branched-chain-enoyl-CoA reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With a flavin as acceptor
SYSNAME     2-methyl-branched-chain-acyl-CoA:electron-transfer flavoprotein 2-oxidoreductase
REACTION    2-methylbutanoyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein = (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein + H+ [RN:R03169]
ALL_REAC    R03169
SUBSTRATE   2-methylbutanoyl-CoA [CPD:C01033];
            electron-transfer flavoprotein [CPD:C04253]
PRODUCT     (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA;
