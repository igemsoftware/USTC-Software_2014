            sucrose-6-phosphate phosphatase;
            SPP
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     sucrose-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    sucrose 6F-phosphate + H2O = sucrose + phosphate [RN:R00805 R06211]
ALL_REAC    R00805 R06211(G)
SUBSTRATE   sucrose 6F-phosphate [CPD:C02591];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     sucrose [CPD:C00089];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+ for maximal activity [2]. This is the final step in the sucrose-biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme is highly specific for sucrose 6-phosphate, with fructose 6-phosphate unable to act as a substrate [2]. Belongs in the haloacid dehydrogenase (HAD) superfamily. The F of sucrose 6F-phosphate is used to indicate that the fructose residue of sucrose carries the substituent.
