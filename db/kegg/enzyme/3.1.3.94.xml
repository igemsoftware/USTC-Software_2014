ENTRY       EC 3.1.3.94                 Enzyme
NAME        D-galactose 1-phosphate phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate + H2O = D-galactose + phosphate [RN:R10622]
ALL_REAC    R10622
SUBSTRATE   alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00446];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     D-galactose [CPD:C00124];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     The human enzyme also has the activity of EC 3.1.3.25, inositol-phosphate phosphatase. The enzyme has very low activity with L-galactose 1-phosphate (cf. EC 3.1.3.93, L-galactose 1-phosphate phosphatase).
