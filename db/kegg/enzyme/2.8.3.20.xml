ENTRY       EC 2.8.3.20                 Enzyme
NAME        succinyl-CoA---D-citramalate CoA-transferase;
            Sct
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            CoA-transferases
SYSNAME     succinyl-CoA:(R)-citramalate CoA-transferase
REACTION    (1) succinyl-CoA + (R)-citramalate = succinate + (R)-citramalyl-CoA [RN:R10640];
            (2) succinyl-CoA + (R)-malate = succinate + (R)-malyl-CoA [RN:R10641]
ALL_REAC    R10640 R10641
SUBSTRATE   succinyl-CoA [CPD:C00091];
            (R)-citramalate [CPD:C02612];
            (R)-malate [CPD:C00497]
PRODUCT     succinate [CPD:C00042];
            (R)-citramalyl-CoA [CPD:C20746];
            (R)-malyl-CoA [CPD:C20747]
COMMENT     The enzyme, purified from the bacterium Clostridium tetanomorphum, can also accept itaconate as acceptor, with lower efficiency.
