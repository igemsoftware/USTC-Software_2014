ENTRY       EC 1.5.1.31                 Enzyme
NAME        berberine reductase;
            (R)-canadine synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-tetrahydroberberine:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (R)-canadine + 2 NADP+ = berberine + 2 NADPH + H+ [RN:R07169]
ALL_REAC    R07169
SUBSTRATE   (R)-canadine [CPD:C11818];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     berberine [CPD:C00757];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Involved in alkaloid biosynthesis in Corydalis cava to give (R)-canadine with the opposite configuration to the precursor of berberine (see EC 1.3.3.8 tetrahydroberberine oxidase). Also acts on 7,8-dihydroberberine.
