ENTRY       EC 1.17.4.3       Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Transferred to 1.17.7.1
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on CH or CH2 groups;
            With a disulfide as acceptor
COMMENT     Transferred entry: 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase. As ferredoxin and not protein-disulfide is now known to take part in the reaction, the enzyme has been transferred to EC 1.17.7.1, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase.
HISTORY     EC 1.17.4.3 created 2003, deleted 2009
