ENTRY       EC 1.3.1.95                 Enzyme
NAME        acrylyl-CoA reductase (NADH)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     propanoyl-CoA:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    propanoyl-CoA + NAD+ = acryloyl-CoA + NADH + H+ [RN:R10161]
ALL_REAC    R10161
SUBSTRATE   propanoyl-CoA [CPD:C00100];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     acryloyl-CoA [CPD:C00894];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Contains FAD. The reaction is catalysed in the opposite direction to that shown. The enzyme from the bacterium Clostridium propionicum is a complex that includes an electron-transfer flavoprotein (ETF). The ETF is reduced by NADH and transfers the electrons to the active site. Catalyses a step in a pathway for L-alanine fermentation to propanoate [1]. cf. EC 1.3.1.84, acrylyl-CoA reductase (NADPH).
