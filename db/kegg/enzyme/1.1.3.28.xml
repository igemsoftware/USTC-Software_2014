ENTRY       EC 1.1.3.28                 Enzyme
NAME        nucleoside oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     nucleoside:oxygen 5'-oxidoreductase
REACTION    inosine + O2 = 9-riburonosylhypoxanthine + H2O [RN:R05821];
            (1a) 2 inosine + O2 = 2 5'-dehydroinosine + 2 H2O [RN:R00055];
            (1b) 2 5'-dehydroinosine + O2 = 2 9-riburonosylhypoxanthine [RN:R05822]
ALL_REAC    R00055 R05821 R05822
SUBSTRATE   inosine [CPD:C00294];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            5'-dehydroinosine [CPD:C01993]
PRODUCT     9-riburonosylhypoxanthine [CPD:C11631];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            5'-dehydroinosine [CPD:C01993]
COMMENT     Other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (as well as 2'-deoxynucleosides) are substrates, but ribose and nucleotides are not substrates. The overall reaction takes place in two separate steps, with the 5'-dehydro nucleoside being released from the enzyme to serve as substrate for the second reaction. This enzyme differs from EC 1.1.3.39, nucleoside oxidase (H2O2-forming), as it produces water rather than hydrogen peroxide.
