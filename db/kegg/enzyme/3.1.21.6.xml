NAME        CC-preferring endodeoxyribonuclease;
            Streptomyces glaucescens exocytoplasmic dodeoxyribonuclease
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Endodeoxyribonucleases producing 5'-phosphomonoesters
REACTION    endonucleolytic cleavage to give 5'-phosphooligonucleotide end-products, with a preference for cleavage within the sequence CC
COMMENT     Prefers CC sites in double-stranded circular and linear DNA. Greater affinity for double-stranded than single-stranded DNA. Produces nicks, generating double-stranded fragments with 5'- and/or 3'-protruding single-stranded tails. Requires magnesium ions for activity. The endonuclease from Chlorella-like green algae infected with NYs-1 virus 4[1] may be the same enzyme.
