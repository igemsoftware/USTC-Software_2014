ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.227                Enzyme
NAME        (-)-borneol dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (-)-borneol:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (-)-borneol + NAD+ = (-)-camphor + NADH + H+ [RN:R02945]
ALL_REAC    R02945
SUBSTRATE   (-)-borneol [CPD:C01766];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     (-)-camphor [CPD:C00809];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     NADP+ can also act, but more slowly.
