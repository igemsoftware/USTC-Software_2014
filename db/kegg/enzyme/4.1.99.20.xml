NAME        3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate synthase;
            3,4-AHBA synthase;
            griH (gene name)

SYSNAME     2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-oxo-7-(phosphonooxy)heptanoate hydro-lyase (cyclizing, 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate-forming)
REACTION    2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-oxo-7-(phosphonooxy)heptanoate = 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate + phosphate + 2 H2O [RN:R10469]
ALL_REAC    R10469
SUBSTRATE   2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-oxo-7-(phosphonooxy)heptanoate [CPD:C20644]
PRODUCT     3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C12115];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Requires Mn2+ for maximum activity. The reaction is suggested to take place in several steps. Schiff base formation, double bond migration and dephosphorylation followed by ring opening and closing to form a pyrrolidine ring, and finally dehydration to form the product 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate. In the bacterium Streptomyces griseus the enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of grixazone, a yellow pigment that contains a phenoxazinone chromophore.
