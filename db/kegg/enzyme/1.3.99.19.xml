NAME        quinoline-4-carboxylate 2-oxidoreductase;
            quinaldic acid 4-oxidoreductase;
            quinoline-4-carboxylate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     quinoline-4-carboxylate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating)
REACTION    quinoline-4-carboxylate + acceptor + H2O = 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylate + reduced acceptor [RN:R05183]
ALL_REAC    R05183
SUBSTRATE   quinoline-4-carboxylate [CPD:C06414];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxylate [CPD:C16715];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A molybdenum---iron---sulfur flavoprotein with molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide as the molybdenum cofactor. Quinoline, 4-methylquinoline and 4-chloroquinoline can also serve as substrates for the enzyme from Agrobacterium sp. 1B. Iodonitrotetrazolium chloride, thionine, menadione and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol can act as electron acceptors.
