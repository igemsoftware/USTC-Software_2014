ENTRY       EC 1.3.8.10                 Enzyme
NAME        cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With a flavin as acceptor
SYSNAME     cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA:electron transfer flavoprotein oxidoreductase
REACTION    cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein = cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein [RN:R09252]
ALL_REAC    R09252
SUBSTRATE   cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA [CPD:C09811];
            electron-transfer flavoprotein [CPD:C04253]
PRODUCT     cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA [CPD:C06322];
            reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein [CPD:C04570]
COMMENT     Contains FAD. The enzyme, characterized from the strict anaerobic bacterium Syntrophus aciditrophicus, is involved in production of cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, a byproduct produced by that organism during fermentation of benzoate and crotonate to acetate.
