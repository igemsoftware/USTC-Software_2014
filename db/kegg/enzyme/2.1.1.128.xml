ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.128                Enzyme
NAME        (RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (RS)-norcoclaurine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (RS)-coclaurine [RN:R05162]
ALL_REAC    R05162 > R05123;
            (other) R04715 R05214
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            (R,S)-norcoclaurine [CPD:C06346]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            (R,S)-coclaurine [CPD:C06348]
COMMENT     The enzyme will also catalyse the 6-O-methylation of (RS)-norlaudanosoline to form 6-O-methyl-norlaudanosoline, but this alkaloid has not been found to occur in plants.
