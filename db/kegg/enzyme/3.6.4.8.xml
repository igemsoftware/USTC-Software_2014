ENTRY       EC 3.6.4.8                  Enzyme
NAME        proteasome ATPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on acid anhydrides to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement
SYSNAME     ATP phosphohydrolase (polypeptide-degrading)
REACTION    ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate [RN:R00086]
ALL_REAC    R00086
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Belongs to the AAA-type superfamily and, like EC 3.6.4.5 (minus-end-directed kinesin ATPase), is involved in channel gating and polypeptide unfolding before proteolysis in the proteasome. Six ATPase subunits are present in the regulatory particle (RP) of 26S proteasome.
