SYSNAME     methylated monomethylamine-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase
REACTION    a [methyl-Co(III) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + coenzyme M = methyl-CoM + a [Co(I) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein] [RN:R10000]
ALL_REAC    R10000;
            (other) R09124 R09998 R09999
SUBSTRATE   [methyl-Co(III) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein];
            coenzyme M [CPD:C19637]
PRODUCT     methyl-CoM [CPD:C03920];
            [Co(I) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein]
COMMENT     Contains zinc [2]. The enzyme, which is involved in methanogenesis from mono-, di-, and trimethylamine, catalyses the transfer of a methyl group bound to the cobalt cofactor of several corrinoid proteins (mono-, di-, and trimethylamine-specific corrinoid proteins, cf. EC 2.1.1.248, methylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.249, dimethylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, and EC 2.1.1.250, trimethylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase) to coenzyme M, forming the substrate for EC 2.8.4.1, coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase, the enzyme that catalyses the final step in methanogenesis.
