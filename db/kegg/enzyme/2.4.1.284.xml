NAME        2-deoxystreptamine glucosyltransferase;
            kanF (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     UDP-alpha-D-glucose:2-deoxystreptamine 6-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 2-deoxystreptamine = UDP + 2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyparomamine [RN:R10096]
ALL_REAC    R10096
SUBSTRATE   UDP-alpha-D-glucose [CPD:C00029];
            2-deoxystreptamine [CPD:C02627]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyparomamine [CPD:C20353]
COMMENT     Involved in the biosynthesis of kanamycin B and kanamycin C. Also catalyses EC 2.4.1.283, 2-deoxystreptamine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase, but activity is only one fifth of that with UDP-alpha-D-glucose.
