            cap2-MTase;
            mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase (ambiguous)

SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5'-(N7-methyl 5'-triphosphoguanosine)-(2'-O-methyl-purine-ribonucleotide)-ribonucleotide-[mRNA] 2'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + a 5'-(N7-methyl 5'-triphosphoguanosine)-(2'-O-methyl-purine-ribonucleotide)-(ribonucleotide)-[mRNA] = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + a 5'-(N7-methyl 5'-triphosphoguanosine)-(2'-O-methyl-purine-ribonucleotide)-(2'-O-methyl-ribonucleotide)-[mRNA]
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            5'-(N7-methyl 5'-triphosphoguanosine)-(2'-O-methyl-purine-ribonucleotide)-(ribonucleotide)-[mRNA]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            5'-(N7-methyl 5'-triphosphoguanosine)-(2'-O-methyl-purine-ribonucleotide)-(2'-O-methyl-ribonucleotide)-[mRNA]
COMMENT     The enzyme, found in higher eukaryotes including insects and vertebrates, and their viruses, methylates the ribose of the ribonucleotide at the second transcribed position of mRNAs and snRNAs. This methylation event is known as cap2. The human enzyme can also methylate mRNA molecules where the upstream purine ribonucleotide is not methylated (see EC 2.1.1.57, methyltransferase cap1), but with lower efficiency [2].
