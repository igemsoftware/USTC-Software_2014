NAME        geranylgeranyl diphosphate diphosphatase;
            geranylgeranyl diphosphate phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Diphosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphohydrolase
REACTION    geranylgeranyl diphosphate + H2O = geranylgeraniol + diphosphate [RN:R08993]
ALL_REAC    R08993
SUBSTRATE   geranylgeranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00353];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     geranylgeraniol [CPD:C09094];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Involved in the biosynthesis of plaunotol. There are two isoenzymes with different ion requirements. Neither require Mg2+ but in addition PII is inhibited by Zn2+, Mn2+ and Co2+. It is not known which isoenzyme is involved in plaunotol biosynthesis.
