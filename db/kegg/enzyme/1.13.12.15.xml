NAME        3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidative deaminase;
            3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine: oxidative deaminase;
            oxidative deaminase;
            DOPA oxidative deaminase;
            DOPAODA
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases or internal mixed-function oxidases)
SYSNAME     3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating)
REACTION    2 L-dopa + O2 = 2 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvate + 2 NH3 [RN:R08920]
ALL_REAC    R08920
SUBSTRATE   L-dopa [CPD:C00355];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvate [CPD:C04045];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     This enzyme is one of the three enzymes involved in L-dopa (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) catabolism in the non-oxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus OU5 (and not Rhodobacter sphaeroides OU5 as had been thought [1]), the other two being EC 4.3.1.22 (dihydroxyphenylalanine reductive deaminase) and EC 2.6.1.49 (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine transaminase). In addition to L-dopa, the enzyme can also use L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan and glutamate as substrate, but more slowly. The enzyme is inhibited by NADH and 2-oxoglutarate.
