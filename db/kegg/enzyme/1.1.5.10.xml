ENTRY       EC 1.1.5.10                 Enzyme
NAME        D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (quinone);
            (R)-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase;
            (R)-2-hydroxy-acid:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase;
            D-lactate dehydrogenase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With a quinone or similar compound as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-2-hydroxyacid:quinone oxidoreductase
REACTION    (R)-2-hydroxyacid + a quinone = 2-oxoacid + a quinol [RN:R10625]
ALL_REAC    R10625
SUBSTRATE   (R)-2-hydroxyacid [CPD:C02489];
            quinone [CPD:C15602]
PRODUCT     2-oxo acid [CPD:C00161];
            quinol [CPD:C15603]
COMMENT     The enzyme from mammalian kidney contains one mole of FAD per mole of enzyme.(R)-lactate, (R)-malate and meso-tartrate are good substrates. Ubiquinone-1 and the dye 2,6-dichloroindophenol can act as acceptors; NAD+ and NADP+ are not acceptors.
