ENTRY       EC 3.4.22.67                Enzyme
NAME        zingipain;
            ginger protease;
            GP-I;
            GP-II;
            ginger protease II (Zingiber officinale);
            zingibain
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Cysteine endopeptidases
REACTION    Preferential cleavage of peptides with a proline residue at the P2 position
COMMENT     This enzyme is found in ginger (Zingiber officinale) rhizome and is a member of the papain family. GP-II contains two glycosylation sites. The enzyme is inhibited by some divalent metal ions, such as Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ [2]. Belongs in peptidase family C1.
