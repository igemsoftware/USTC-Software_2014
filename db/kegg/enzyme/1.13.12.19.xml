ENTRY       EC 1.13.12.19               Enzyme
NAME        2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (ethylene-forming);
            ethylene-forming enzyme;
            EFE
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases or internal mixed-function oxidases)
SYSNAME     2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (decarboxylating, ethylene-forming)
REACTION    2-oxoglutarate + O2 = ethylene + 3 CO2 + H2O [RN:R09784]
ALL_REAC    R09784
SUBSTRATE   2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     ethylene [CPD:C06547];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     This is one of two simultaneous reactions catalysed by the enzyme, which is responsible for ethylene production in bacteria of the Pseudomonas syringae group. In the other reaction [EC 1.14.11.34, 2-oxoglutarate/L-arginine monooxygenase/decarboxylase (succinate-forming)] the enzyme catalyses the mono-oxygenation of both 2-oxoglutarate and L-arginine, forming succinate, carbon dioxide and L-hydroxyarginine, which is subsequently cleaved into guanidine and (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate.
            The enzymes catalyse two cycles of the ethylene-forming reaction for each cycle of the succinate-forming reaction, so that the stoichiometry of the products ethylene and succinate is 2:1.
