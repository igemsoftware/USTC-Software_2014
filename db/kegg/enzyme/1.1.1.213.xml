            3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase;
            3alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P)+ 3-oxidoreductase (A-specific);
            3alpha-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase (A-specific)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     3alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P)+ 3-oxidoreductase (Re-specific)
REACTION    a 3alpha-hydroxysteroid + NAD(P)+ = a 3-oxosteroid + NAD(P)H + H+ [RN:R10422 R10423]

SUBSTRATE   3alpha-hydroxysteroid [CPD:C03072];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     3-oxosteroid [CPD:C01876];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme acts on multiple 3alpha-hydroxysteroids. Re-specific with respect to NAD+ or NADP+ [cf. EC 1.1.1.50, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase (Si-specific)]. Enzymes whose stereo-specificity with respect to NAD+ or NADP+ is not known are described by EC 1.1.1.357, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase.
