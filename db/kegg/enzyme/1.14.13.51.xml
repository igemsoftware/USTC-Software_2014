NAME        6-oxocineole dehydrogenase;
            6-oxocineole oxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     6-oxocineole,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    6-oxocineole + NADPH + H+ + O2 = 1,6,6-trimethyl-2,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-3-one + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R02995]
ALL_REAC    R02995
SUBSTRATE   6-oxocineole [CPD:C00848];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     1,6,6-trimethyl-2,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-3-one [CPD:C04718];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The product undergoes non-enzymic cleavage and subsequent ring closure to form the lactone 4,5-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-4-(3-oxobutyl)furan-2(3H)-one.
