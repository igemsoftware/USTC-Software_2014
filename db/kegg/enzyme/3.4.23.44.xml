NAME        nodavirus endopeptidase;
            Black Beetle virus endopeptidase;
            Flock House virus endopeptidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Aspartic endopeptidases
REACTION    Hydrolysis of an asparaginyl bond involved in the maturation of the structural protein of the virus, typically -Asn!Ala- or -Asn!Phe-
COMMENT     A single aspartic residue is critical for activity, and inhibition by EDTA indicates that a metal ion is also important. The enzyme is known from several nodaviruses that are pathogens of insects. Type example of peptidase family A6, and structurally related to the tetravirus endopeptidase in family A21, although in that family, the catalytic residue is thought to be Glu.
