ENTRY       EC 3.5.1.39                 Enzyme
NAME        alkylamidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In linear amides
SYSNAME     N-methylhexanamide amidohydrolase
REACTION    N-methylhexanamide + H2O = hexanoate + methylamine [RN:R03620]
ALL_REAC    R03620
SUBSTRATE   N-methylhexanamide [CPD:C02722];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     hexanoate [CPD:C01585];
