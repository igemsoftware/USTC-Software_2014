ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.167              Enzyme
NAME        4-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase;
            pnpA (gene name);
            pdcA (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-nitrophenol,NAD(P)H:oxygen 4-oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating, nitrite-forming)
REACTION    4-nitrophenol + NADPH + H+ + O2 = 1,4-benzoquinone + nitrite + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R05258]
ALL_REAC    R05258
SUBSTRATE   4-nitrophenol [CPD:C00870];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     1,4-benzoquinone [CPD:C00472];
            nitrite [CPD:C00088];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Contains FAD. The enzyme catalyses the first step in a degradation pathway for 4-nitrophenol, the oxidation of 4-nitrophenol at position 4 with the concomitant removal of the nitro group as nitrite. The enzyme from the bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain WBC-3 also catalyses EC 1.14.13.166, 4-nitrocatechol 4-monooxygenase.
