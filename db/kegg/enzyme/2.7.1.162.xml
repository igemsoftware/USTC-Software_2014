            N-acetylgalactosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 1-kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:N-acetyl-D-hexosamine 1-phosphotransferase

SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            N-acetyl-D-hexosamine [CPD:C03136]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            N-acetyl-alpha-D-hexosamine 1-phosphate [CPD:C18055]
COMMENT     This enzyme is involved in the lacto-N-biose I/galacto-N-biose degradation pathway in the probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium longum. Differs from EC 2.7.1.157, N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, as it can phosphorylate both N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine at similar rates. Also has some activity with N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, D-talose and D-mannose as substrate. ATP can be replaced by GTP or ITP but with decreased enzyme activity. Requires a divalent cation, with Mg2+ resulting in by far the greatest stimulation of enzyme activity.
