NAME        sulfide dehydrogenase;
            SuDH
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on a sulfur group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     hydrogen sulfide,polysulfide:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    hydrogen sulfide + (sulfide)n + NADP+ = (sulfide)n+1 + NADPH + H+ [RN:R10512]
ALL_REAC    R10512
SUBSTRATE   hydrogen sulfide [CPD:C00283];
            (sulfide)n [CPD:C19692];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     (sulfide)n+1;
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     A iron-sulfur flavoprotein. In the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus the enzyme is involved in the oxidation of NADPH which is produced in peptide degradation. The enzyme also catalyses the reduction of sulfur with lower activity.
