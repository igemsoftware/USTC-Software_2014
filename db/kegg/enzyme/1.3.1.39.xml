COMMENT     This enzyme completes each cycle of fatty acid elongation by catalysing the stereospecific reduction of the double bond at position 2 of a growing fatty acid chain, while linked to an acyl-carrier protein. It is one of the activities of EC 2.3.1.85, animal fatty-acid synthase. The mammalian enzyme is Re-specific with respect to NADP+. cf. EC 1.3.1.10, enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH, Si-specific) and EC 1.3.1.104, enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH).
