ENTRY       EC 2.8.1.5                  Enzyme
NAME        thiosulfate---dithiol sulfurtransferase;
            thiosulfate reductase;
            TSR
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            Sulfurtransferases
SYSNAME     thiosulfate:dithioerythritol sulfurtransferase
REACTION    thiosulfate + dithioerythritol = sulfite + 4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiacyclohexane (i.e. oxidized dithioerythritol) + sulfide [RN:R05072]
ALL_REAC    R05072
SUBSTRATE   thiosulfate [CPD:C00320];
            dithioerythritol [CPD:C00950]
PRODUCT     sulfite [CPD:C00094];
            4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiacyclohexane [CPD:C06484];
            sulfide [CPD:C00283]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Chlorella shows very little activity towards monothiols such as glutathione and cysteine (cf. EC 2.8.1.3 thiosulfate---thiolsulfurtransferase). The enzyme probably transfers the sulfur atom onto one thiol group to form -S-S-, and sulfide is spontaneously expelled from this by reaction with the other thiol group. May be identical with EC 2.8.1.1 thiosulfate sulfurtransferase.
