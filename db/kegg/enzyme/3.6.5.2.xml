ENTRY       EC 3.6.5.2                  Enzyme
NAME        small monomeric GTPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on GTP to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement
SYSNAME     GTP phosphohydrolase (cell-regulating)

ALL_REAC    R00335
SUBSTRATE   GTP [CPD:C00044];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]

COMMENT     A family of about 50 enzymes with a molecular mass of 21 kDa that are distantly related to the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein GTPase (EC 3.6.5.1). They are involved in cell-growth regulation (Ras subfamily), membrane vesicle traffic and uncoating (Rab and ARF subfamilies), nuclear protein import (Ran subfamily) and organization of the cytoskeleton (Rho and Rac subfamilies).
