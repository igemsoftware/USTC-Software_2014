ENTRY       EC 3.1.2.26                 Enzyme
NAME        bile-acid-CoA hydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Thioester hydrolases
SYSNAME     deoxycholoyl-CoA hydrolase
REACTION    deoxycholoyl-CoA + H2O = CoA + deoxycholate [RN:R07295]
ALL_REAC    R07295
SUBSTRATE   deoxycholoyl-CoA [CPD:C15560];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            deoxycholate [CPD:C04483]
COMMENT     Choloyl-CoA, 3-dehydrocholoyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA can also act as substrates, but acetyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA and phenylacetyl-CoA cannot.
