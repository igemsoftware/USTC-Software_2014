ENTRY       EC 1.14.21.4                Enzyme
NAME        salutaridine synthase;
            (R)-reticuline oxidase (C-C phenol-coupling)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated
SYSNAME     (R)-reticuline,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-C phenol-coupling)
REACTION    (R)-reticuline + NADPH + H+ + O2 = salutaridine + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R04696]
ALL_REAC    R04696
SUBSTRATE   (R)-reticuline [CPD:C05178];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     salutaridine [CPD:C05179];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450). Forms the morphinan alkaloid salutaridine by intramolecular phenol oxidation of reticuline without the incorporation of oxygen into the product.
