ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.269                Enzyme
NAME        2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase;
            2-(2-(S)-hydroxypropylthio)ethanesulfonate dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     2-[2-(S)-hydroxypropylthio]ethanesulfonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM + NAD+ = 2-oxopropyl-CoM + NADH + H+ [RN:R05690]
ALL_REAC    R05690
SUBSTRATE   2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM [CPD:C11498];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     2-oxopropyl-CoM [CPD:C11497];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme is highly specific for (S)-2-hydroxyalkyl thioethers of CoM, in contrast to EC 1.1.1.268, 2-(R)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase, which is highly specific for the (R)-enantiomer. This enzyme forms component IV of a four-component enzyme system {comprising EC 4.4.1.23 (2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase; component I), EC 1.8.1.5 [2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating); component II], EC 1.1.1.268 [2-(R)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component III] and EC 1.1.1.269 [2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component IV]} that is involved in epoxyalkane carboxylation in Xanthobacter sp. strain Py2.
