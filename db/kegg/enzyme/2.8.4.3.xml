COMMENT     This bacterial enzyme binds two [4Fe-4S] clusters as well as the transferred sulfur [3]. The enzyme is a member of the superfamily of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent radical (radical AdoMet) enzymes. The sulfur donor is believed to be one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters, which is sacrificed in the process, so that in vitro the reaction is a single turnover.
