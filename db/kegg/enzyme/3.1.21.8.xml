ENTRY       EC 3.1.21.8                 Enzyme
NAME        T4 deoxyribonuclease II;
            T4 endonuclease II;
            EndoII (ambiguous);
            denA (gene name)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Endodeoxyribonucleases producing 5'-phosphomonoesters
REACTION    Endonucleolytic nicking and cleavage of cytosine-containing double-stranded DNA.
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+. This phage T4 enzyme is involved in degradation of host DNA. The enzyme primarily catalyses nicking of the bottom strand of double stranded DNA between the first and second base pair to the right of a top-strand CCGC motif. Double-stranded breaks are produced 5- to 10-fold less frequently [3]. It does not cleave the T4 native DNA, which contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine instead of cytosine.
