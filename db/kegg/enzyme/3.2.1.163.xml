NAME        1,6-alpha-D-mannosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     (1->6)-alpha-mannosyl alpha-D-mannohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of the (1->6)-linked alpha-D-mannose residues in alpha-D-Manp-(1->6)-D-Manp
COMMENT     The enzyme is specific for (1->6)-linked mannobiose and has no activity towards any other linkages, or towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside or baker's yeast mannan. It is strongly inhibited by Mn2+ but does not require Ca2+ or any other metal cofactor for activity.
