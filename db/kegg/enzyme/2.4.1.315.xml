SYSNAME     UDP-alpha-D-glucose:1,2-diacyl-3-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol 6-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    (1) UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol = 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol + UDP;
            (2) UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol = 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol + UDP

            1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol
PRODUCT     1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol;
            UDP [CPD:C00015];
            1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol
COMMENT     The enzyme is found in several bacterial species. The enzyme from Bacillus subtilis is specific for glucose and can form tetraglucosyl diacylglycerol in vitro [1]. The enzyme from Mycoplasma genitalium can incoporate galactose with similar efficiency, but forms mainly 1,2-diacyl-diglucopyranosyl-sn-glycerol in vivo [3]. The enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus can also form glucosyl-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-sn-glycerol) [2].
