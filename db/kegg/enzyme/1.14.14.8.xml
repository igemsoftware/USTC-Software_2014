NAME        anthranilate 3-monooxygenase (FAD);
            anthranilate 3-hydroxylase;
            anthranilate hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With reduced flavin or flavoprotein as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     anthranilate,FADH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    anthranilate + FADH2 + O2 = 3-hydroxyanthranilate + FAD + H2O [RN:R09517]
ALL_REAC    R09517
SUBSTRATE   anthranilate [CPD:C00108];
            FADH2 [CPD:C01352];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     3-hydroxyanthranilate [CPD:C00632];

            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     This enzyme, isolated from the bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, participates in the pathway of tryptophan degradation. The enzyme is part of a system that also includes a bifunctional riboflavin kinase/FMN adenylyltransferase and an FAD reductase, which ensures ample supply of FAD to the monooxygenase.
