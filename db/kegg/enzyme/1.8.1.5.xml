ENTRY       EC 1.8.1.5                  Enzyme
NAME        2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating);
            NADPH:2-(2-ketopropylthio)ethanesulfonate oxidoreductase/carboxylase;
            NADPH:2-ketopropyl-coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on a sulfur group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     2-mercaptoethanesulfonate,acetoacetate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    2-mercaptoethanesulfonate + acetoacetate + NADP+ = 2-(2-oxopropylthio)ethanesulfonate + CO2 + NADPH [RN:R05713]
ALL_REAC    R05713
SUBSTRATE   2-mercaptoethanesulfonate [CPD:C03576];
            acetoacetate [CPD:C00164];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     2-(2-oxopropylthio)ethanesulfonate [CPD:C11497];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005]
COMMENT     Also acts on thioethers longer in chain length on the oxo side, e.g. 2-oxobutyl-CoM, but this portion must be attached to CoM (2-mercaptoethanesulfonate); no CoM analogs will substitute. This enzyme forms component II of a four-component enzyme system {comprising EC 4.4.1.23 (2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase; component I), EC 1.8.1.5 [2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating); component II], EC 1.1.1.268 [2-(R)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component III] and EC 1.1.1.269 [2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component IV]} that is involved in epoxyalkane carboxylation in Xanthobacter sp. strain Py2.
