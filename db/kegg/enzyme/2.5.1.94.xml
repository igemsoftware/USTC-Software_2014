NAME        adenosyl-chloride synthase;
            chlorinase;
            5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine synthase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:chloride adenosyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + chloride = 5-deoxy-5-chloroadenosine + L-methionine [RN:R09639]
ALL_REAC    R09639
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            chloride [CPD:C00698]
PRODUCT     5-deoxy-5-chloroadenosine [CPD:C19768];
            L-methionine [CPD:C00073]
COMMENT     This enzyme, isolated from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica, catalyses an early step in the pathway leading to biosynthesis of the proteosome inhibitor salinosporamide A. The enzyme is very similar to EC 2.5.1.63, adenosyl-fluoride synthase, but does not accept fluoride.
