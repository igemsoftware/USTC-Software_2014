            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The liver enzyme acts on enoyl-CoA derivatives of carbon chain length 4 to 16, with optimum activity on 2-hexenoyl-CoA. In Escherichia coli, cis-specific and trans-specific enzymes exist [EC 1.3.1.37 cis-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH) and EC 1.3.1.38 trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)].
