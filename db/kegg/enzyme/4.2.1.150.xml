NAME        short-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase;
            3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase;
            crotonase;
            crt (gene name)
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Hydro-lyases
SYSNAME     short-chain-(3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase
REACTION    a short-chain (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA = a short-chain trans-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
SUBSTRATE   short-chain (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
PRODUCT     short-chain trans-2-enoyl-CoA;
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is part of the central fermentation pathway and plays a key role in the production of both acids and solvents. It is specific for short, C4-C6, chain length substrates and exhibits an extremely high turnover number for crotonyl-CoA. cf. EC 4.2.1.17, enoyl-CoA hydratase and EC 4.2.1.74, long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase.
