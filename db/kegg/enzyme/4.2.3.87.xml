ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.87                 Enzyme
NAME        alpha-guaiene synthase;
            PatTps177 (gene name)
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, alpha-guaiene-forming)
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = alpha-guaiene + diphosphate [RN:R09887]
ALL_REAC    R09887
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     alpha-guaiene [CPD:C20161];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+. The enzyme from Pogostemon cablin gives 13% alpha-guaiene as well as 37% (-)-patchoulol (see EC 4.2.3.70), 13% delta-guaiene (see EC 4.2.3.93), and traces of at least ten other sesquiterpenoids [1]. In Aquilaria crassna three clones of the enzyme gave about 80% delta-guaiene and 20% alpha-guaiene, with traces of alpha-humulene. A fourth clone gave 54% delta-guaiene and 45% alpha-guaiene [2].
