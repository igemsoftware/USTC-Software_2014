NAME        glucoside 3-dehydrogenase;
            D-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase;
            D-aldohexopyranoside dehydrogenase;
            D-aldohexoside:cytochrome c oxidoreductase;
            D-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase;
            hexopyranoside-cytochrome c oxidoreductase;
            D-aldohexoside:(acceptor) 3-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     D-aldohexoside:acceptor 3-oxidoreductase
REACTION    sucrose + acceptor = 3-dehydro-alpha-D-glucosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside + reduced acceptor [RN:R00808]
ALL_REAC    R00808 > R00807 R06233(G);
            (other) R01680 R06219(G)
SUBSTRATE   sucrose [CPD:C00089];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     3-dehydro-alpha-D-glucosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside [CPD:C05731];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein (FAD). The enzyme acts on D-glucose, D-galactose, D-glucosides and D-galactosides, but D-glucosides react more rapidly than D-galactosides.
