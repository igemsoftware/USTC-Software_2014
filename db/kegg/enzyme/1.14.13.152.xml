ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.152              Enzyme
NAME        geraniol 8-hydroxylase;
            CYP76B6;
            G10H;
            CrG10H;
            SmG10H
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     geraniol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating)
REACTION    geraniol + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R08785]
ALL_REAC    R08785
SUBSTRATE   geraniol [CPD:C01500];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol [CPD:C17621];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Requires cytochrome P-450. Also hydroxylates nerol and citronellol, cf. EC 1.14.13.151 linalool 8-monooxygenase. The recommended numbering of geraniol gives 8-hydroxygeraniol as the product rather than 10-hydroxygeraniol as used by references 1-3. See prenol nomenclature {iupac/misc/prenol#p1::Pr-1}. The cloned enzyme also catalysed, but less efficiently, the 3'-hydroxylation of naringenin (cf. EC 1.14.13.21, flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase) [3].
