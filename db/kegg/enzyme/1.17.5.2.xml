ENTRY       EC 1.17.5.2                 Enzyme
NAME        caffeine dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on CH or CH2 groups;
            With a quinone or similar compound as acceptor
SYSNAME     caffeine:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
REACTION    caffeine + ubiquinone + H2O = 1,3,7-trimethylurate + ubiquinol [RN:R07980]
ALL_REAC    R07980
SUBSTRATE   caffeine [CPD:C07481];
            ubiquinone [CPD:C00399];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     1,3,7-trimethylurate [CPD:C16361];
            ubiquinol [CPD:C00390]
COMMENT     This enzyme, characterized from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas sp. CBB1, catalyses the incorporation of an oxygen atom originating from a water molecule into position C-8 of caffeine. The enzyme utilizes short-tail ubiquinones as the preferred electron acceptor.
