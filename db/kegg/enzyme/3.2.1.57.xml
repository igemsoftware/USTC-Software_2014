ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.57                 Enzyme
NAME        isopullulanase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     pullulan 4-glucanohydrolase (isopanose-forming)
REACTION    Hydrolysis of pullulan to isopanose (6-alpha-maltosylglucose)
COMMENT     The enzyme has practically no action on starch. Panose (4-alpha-isomaltosylglucose) is hydrolysed to isomaltose and glucose. cf. EC 3.2.1.41 (pullulanase) and EC 3.2.1.135 (neopullulanase).
