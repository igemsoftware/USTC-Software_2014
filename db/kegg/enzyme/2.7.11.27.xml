SYSNAME     ATP:[acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] = ADP + [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphate [RN:R03272]
ALL_REAC    R03272
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] [CPD:C01139]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphate [CPD:C01247]
COMMENT     Phosphorylates and inactivates EC 6.4.1.2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which can be dephosphorylated and reactivated by EC 3.1.3.17, [phosphorylase] phosphatase. The enzyme is more active towards the dimeric form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase than the polymeric form [5]. Phosphorylates serine residues.
HISTORY     EC 2.7.11.27 created 1990 as EC 2.7.1.128 (EC 2.7.1.111 created 1984, incorporated 1992), transferred 2005 to EC 2.7.11.27
