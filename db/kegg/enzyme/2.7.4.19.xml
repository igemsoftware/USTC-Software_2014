NAME        5-methyldeoxycytidine-5'-phosphate kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:5-methyldeoxycytidine-5'-phosphate phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + 5-methyldeoxycytidine 5'-phosphate = ADP + 5-methyldeoxycytidine diphosphate [RN:R04235]
ALL_REAC    R04235
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            5-methyldeoxycytidine 5'-phosphate [CPD:C03495]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            5-methyldeoxycytidine diphosphate [CPD:C04187]
COMMENT     The enzyme, from phage XP-12-infected Xanthomonas oryzae, converts m5dCMP into m5dCDP and then into m5dCTP.
