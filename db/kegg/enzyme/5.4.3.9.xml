NAME        glutamate 2,3-aminomutase
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Intramolecular transferases;
            Transferring amino groups
SYSNAME     L-glutamate 2,3-aminomutase
REACTION    L-glutamate = 3-aminopentanedioate [RN:R10153]
ALL_REAC    R10153
SUBSTRATE   L-glutamate [CPD:C00025]
PRODUCT     3-aminopentanedioate [CPD:C05574]
COMMENT     This enzyme is a member of the 'AdoMet radical' (radical SAM) family. It contains pyridoxal phosphate and a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is coordinated by 3 cysteines and binds an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine molecule. During the reaction cycle, the AdoMet forms a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is regenerated at the end of the reaction.
