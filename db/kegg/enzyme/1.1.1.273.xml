ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.273                Enzyme
NAME        vellosimine dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     10-deoxysarpagine:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    10-deoxysarpagine + NADP+ = vellosimine + NADPH + H+ [RN:R05827]
ALL_REAC    R05827
SUBSTRATE   10-deoxysarpagine [CPD:C11635];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     vellosimine [CPD:C11634];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Also acts on related alkaloids with an endo-aldehyde group as vellosimine (same stereochemistry at C-16) but only slight activity with exo-aldehydes. Detected in many cell suspension cultures of plants from the family Apocynaceae.
