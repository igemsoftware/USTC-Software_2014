SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tricetin 3',5'-O-dimethyltransferase
REACTION    2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin = 2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin (overall reaction) [RN:R09611];
            (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3'-O-methyltricetin [RN:R09612];
            (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-O-methyltricetin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin [RN:R09613]

            tricetin [CPD:C10192];
            3'-O-methyltricetin [CPD:C19739]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin [CPD:C10193];
            3'-O-methyltricetin [CPD:C19739]
COMMENT     The enzymes from Oryza sativa (ROMT-15 and ROMT-17) catalyses the stepwise methylation of tricetin to its 3'-mono- and 3',5'-dimethyl ethers. In contrast with the wheat enzyme (EC 2.1.1.169, tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase), tricetin dimethyl ether is not converted to its 3',4',5'-trimethylated ether derivative [1]. The enzymes from Hordeum vulgare (HvOMT1) and from Zea mays (ZmOMT1) form the 3',5'-dimethyl derivative as the major product [2].
