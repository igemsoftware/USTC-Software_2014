ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.351                Enzyme
NAME        phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+-dependent, decarboxylating]
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     6-phospho-D-gluconate:NAD(P)+ 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    6-phospho-D-gluconate + NAD(P)+ = D-ribulose 5-phosphate + CO2 + NAD(P)H + H+ [RN:R01528 R10221]
ALL_REAC    R01528 R10221
SUBSTRATE   6-phospho-D-gluconate [CPD:C00345];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     D-ribulose 5-phosphate [CPD:C00199];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme participates in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, whose main purpose is to produce reducing power and pentose for biosynthetic reactions. Unlike EC 1.1.1.44, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (NADP+-dependent, decarboxylating), it is not specific for NADP+ and can accept both cofactors with similar efficiency. cf. EC 1.1.1.343, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [NAD+-dependent, decarboxylating].
