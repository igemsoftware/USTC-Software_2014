            benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase;
            benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase;
            benzoyl-coenzyme A:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase;
            benzoyl-coenzyme A:phenylethanol benzoyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase
REACTION    benzoyl-CoA + benzyl alcohol = CoA + benzyl benzoate [RN:R09528]
ALL_REAC    R09528
SUBSTRATE   benzoyl-CoA [CPD:C00512];
            benzyl alcohol [CPD:C00556]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            benzyl benzoate [CPD:C12537]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in volatile benzenoid and benzoic acid biosynthesis. The enzyme from Petunia hybrida also catalyses the formation of 2-phenylethyl benzoate from benzoyl-CoA and 2-phenylethanol. The apparent catalytic efficiency of the enzyme from Petunia hybrida with benzoyl-CoA is almost 6-fold higher than with acetyl-CoA [1].
