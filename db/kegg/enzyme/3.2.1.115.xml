NAME        branched-dextran exo-1,2-alpha-glucosidase;
            dextran 1,2-alpha-glucosidase;
            dextran alpha-1,2 debranching enzymel 1,2-alpha-D-glucosyl-branched-dextran 2-glucohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     (1->2)-alpha-D-glucosyl-branched-dextran 2-glucohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->2)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages at the branch points of dextrans and related polysaccharides, producing free D-glucose
COMMENT     Does not hydrolyse disaccharides or oligosaccharides containing linear 1,2-alpha-glucosidic linkages.
