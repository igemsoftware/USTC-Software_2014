NAME        methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (ferredoxin);
            5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor
SYSNAME     5-methyltetrahydrofolate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
REACTION    5-methyltetrahydrofolate + 2 oxidized ferredoxin = 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + 2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H+ [RN:R01217]
ALL_REAC    R01217
SUBSTRATE   5-methyltetrahydrofolate [CPD:C00440];
            oxidized ferredoxin [CPD:C00139]
PRODUCT     5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate [CPD:C00143];
            reduced ferredoxin [CPD:C00138];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     An iron-sulfur flavoprotein that also contains zinc. The enzyme from Clostridium formicoaceticum catalyses the reduction of methylene blue, menadione, benzyl viologen, rubredoxin or FAD with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and the oxidation of reduced ferredoxin or FADH2 with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. However, unlike EC 1.5.1.20, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [NAD(P)H], there is no activity with NAD(P)H.
