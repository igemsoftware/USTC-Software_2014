NAME        D-glutamyltransferase;
            D-glutamyl transpeptidase;
            D-gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Aminoacyltransferases
SYSNAME     glutamine:D-glutamyl-peptide 5-glutamyltransferase
REACTION    (1) D-glutamine + D-glutamate = ammonia + gamma-D-glutamyl-D-glutamate [RN:R04011 R04012];
            (2) L(or D)-glutamine + (gamma-D-glutamyl)n-[peptide] = ammonia + (gamma-D-glutamyl)n+1-[peptide]
ALL_REAC    R04011 R04012
SUBSTRATE   D-glutamine [CPD:C00819];
            D-glutamate [CPD:C00217];
            L-glutamine [CPD:C00064];
            (gamma-D-glutamyl)n-[peptide]
PRODUCT     ammonia [CPD:C00014];
            gamma-D-glutamyl-D-glutamate;
            (gamma-D-glutamyl)n+1-[peptide]
COMMENT     The enzyme catalyses two reactions. The first is the transfer of a glutamyl residue from L- or D-glutamine to D-glutamate via a gamma linkage, forming gamma-glutamyl-D-glutamate, and the second is the transfer of additional glutamyl residues to the peptide, extending the polypeptide chain.
