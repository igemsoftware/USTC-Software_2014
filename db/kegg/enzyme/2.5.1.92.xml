COMMENT     This enzyme, originally characterized from wild tomato, specifically forms (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate via neryl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate. In wild tomato it is involved in the biosynthesis of several sesquiterpenes. See also EC 2.5.1.68 [(2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase] and EC 2.5.1.10 [(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase].
