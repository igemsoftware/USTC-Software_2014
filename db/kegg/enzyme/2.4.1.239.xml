SYSNAME     UDP-glucose:flavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucoside 2''-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    UDP-glucose + a flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside = UDP + a flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside [RN:R07339]

SUBSTRATE   UDP-glucose [CPD:C00029];
            flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside [CPD:C03946]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside [CPD:C15581]
COMMENT     One of three specific glucosyltransferases in pea (Pisum sativum) that successively add a beta-D-glucosyl group first to O-3 of kaempferol, and then to O-2 of the previously added glucosyl group giving the 3-O-sophoroside and then the 3-O-sophorotrioside (see also EC 2.4.1.91, flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase and EC 2.4.1.240, flavonol-3-O-glycoside glucosyltransferase). TDP-glucose can replace UDP-glucose as the glucose donor but the reaction proceeds more slowly.
