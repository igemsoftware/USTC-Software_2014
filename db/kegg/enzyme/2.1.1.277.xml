NAME        anthranilate O-methyltransferase;
            AAMT
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:anthranilate O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + anthranilate = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + O-methyl anthranilate [RN:R10451]
ALL_REAC    R10451
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            anthranilate [CPD:C00108]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            O-methyl anthranilate [CPD:C20634]
COMMENT     In the plant maize (Zea mays), the isoforms AAMT1 and AAMT2 are specific for anthranilate while AAMT3 also has the activity of EC 2.1.1.273, benzoate methyltransferase.
