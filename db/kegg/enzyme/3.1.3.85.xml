ENTRY       EC 3.1.3.85                 Enzyme
NAME        glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase;
            GpgP protein
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     alpha-D-glucosyl-3-phospho-D-glycerate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate + H2O = 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate + phosphate [RN:R09664]
ALL_REAC    R09664
SUBSTRATE   2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate [CPD:C19791];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate [CPD:C19792];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate via the two-step pathway in which EC 2.4.1.266 (glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase) catalyses the conversion of GDP-glucose and 3-phospho-D-glycerate into 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate, which is then converted to 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate by glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase. In vivo the enzyme catalyses the dephosphorylation of 2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate with lower efficiency [1,2]. Divalent metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+) stimulate activity [1,2].
