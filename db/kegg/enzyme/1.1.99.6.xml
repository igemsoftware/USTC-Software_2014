ENTRY       EC 1.1.99.6                 Enzyme
NAME        D-lactate dehydrogenase (acceptor);
            D-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase;
            D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase;
            (R)-2-hydroxy-acid:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     (R)-lactate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase
REACTION    (R)-lactate + acceptor = pyruvate + reduced acceptor [RN:R00297]
ALL_REAC    R00297
SUBSTRATE   (R)-lactate [CPD:C00256];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     The zinc flavoprotein (FAD) from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus cannot utilize NAD+, cytochrome c, methylene blue or dimethylnaphthoquinone as acceptors. In vitro it is active with artificial electron acceptors such as 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, but the physiological acceptor is not yet known.
