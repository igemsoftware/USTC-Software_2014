ENTRY       EC 2.7.4.4                  Enzyme
NAME        nucleoside-phosphate kinase;
            NMP-kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:nucleoside-phosphate phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + nucleoside phosphate = ADP + nucleoside diphosphate [RN:R00334]
ALL_REAC    R00334 > R00158 R02098
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            nucleoside phosphate [CPD:C01329]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            nucleoside diphosphate [CPD:C00454]
COMMENT     Many nucleotides can act as acceptors; other nucleoside triphosphates can act instead of ATP.
