SYSNAME     ATP:dephospho-{[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + dephospho-{[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} = ADP + {[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} [RN:R04589]
ALL_REAC    R04589
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            dephospho-{[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase}
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            {[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase}
COMMENT     The enzyme is activated by AMP and is specific for its substrate. Phosphorylates and activates EC 2.7.11.31, [hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase, that has been inactivated by EC 3.1.3.16, protein-serine/threonine phosphatase.
HISTORY     EC 2.7.11.3 created 1984 as EC 2.7.1.110, transferred 2005 to EC 2.7.11.3
