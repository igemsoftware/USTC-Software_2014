NAME        methylglutamate dehydrogenase;
            N-methylglutamate dehydrogenase;
            N-methyl-L-glutamate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase (demethylating)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     N-methyl-L-glutamate:acceptor oxidoreductase (demethylating)
REACTION    N-methyl-L-glutamate + acceptor + H2O = L-glutamate + formaldehyde + reduced acceptor [RN:R00609]
ALL_REAC    R00609
SUBSTRATE   N-methyl-L-glutamate [CPD:C01046];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     L-glutamate [CPD:C00025];
            formaldehyde [CPD:C00067];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A number of N-methyl-substituted amino acids can act as donor; 2,6-dichloroindophenol is the best acceptor.
