ENTRY       EC 1.14.21.5                Enzyme
NAME        (S)-canadine synthase;
            (S)-tetrahydroberberine synthase;
            (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine oxidase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated
SYSNAME     (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
REACTION    (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (S)-canadine + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R04400]
ALL_REAC    R04400
SUBSTRATE   (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine [CPD:C04118];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (S)-canadine [CPD:C03329];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450) catalysing an oxidative reaction that does not incorporate oxygen into the product. Oxidation of the methoxyphenol group of the alkaloid tetrahydrocolumbamine results in the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge of canadine.
