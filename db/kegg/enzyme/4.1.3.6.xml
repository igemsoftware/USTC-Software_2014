ENTRY       EC 4.1.3.6                  Enzyme
NAME        citrate (pro-3S)-lyase;
            citrase;
            citratase;
            citritase;
            citridesmolase;
            citrate aldolase;
            citric aldolase;
            citrate lyase;
            citrate oxaloacetate-lyase;
            citrate oxaloacetate-lyase [(pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate]
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Oxo-acid-lyases
SYSNAME     citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (forming acetate from the pro-S carboxymethyl group of citrate)
REACTION    citrate = acetate + oxaloacetate [RN:R00362]
ALL_REAC    R00362
SUBSTRATE   citrate [CPD:C00158]
PRODUCT     acetate [CPD:C00033];
            oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036]
COMMENT     The enzyme can be dissociated into components, two of which are identical with EC 2.8.3.10 (citrate CoA-transferase) and EC 4.1.3.34 (citryl-CoA lyase). EC 3.1.2.16, citrate lyase deacetylase, deacetylates and inactivates the enzyme.
