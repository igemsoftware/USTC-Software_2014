ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.25               Enzyme
NAME        methane monooxygenase (soluble);
            methane hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     methane,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating)
REACTION    methane + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = methanol + NAD(P)+ + H2O [RN:R01142 R01143]
ALL_REAC    R01142 R01143;
            (other) R02823 R07098 R09141 R09148
SUBSTRATE   methane [CPD:C01438];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     methanol [CPD:C00132];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The enzyme is soluble, in contrast to the particulate enzyme, EC 1.14.18.3. Broad specificity; many alkanes can be hydroxylated, and alkenes are converted into the corresponding epoxides; CO is oxidized to CO2, ammonia is oxidized to hydroxylamine, and some aromatic compounds and cyclic alkanes can also be hydroxylated, but more slowly.
