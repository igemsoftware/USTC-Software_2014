COMMENT     In the fruit-ripening process of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) the reaction is catalysed in the reverse direction from that shown. 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylfuran-3(2H)-one is one of the major aroma compounds in the fruits. The enzyme has also been detected in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits [2]. NADPH is the preferred cofactor.
