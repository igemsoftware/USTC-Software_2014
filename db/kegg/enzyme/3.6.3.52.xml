ENTRY       EC 3.6.3.52                 Enzyme
NAME        chloroplast protein-transporting ATPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances
SYSNAME     ATP phosphohydrolase (chloroplast protein-importing)
REACTION    ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate [RN:R00086]
ALL_REAC    R00086
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     A non-phosphorylated, non-ABC (ATP-binding cassette) ATPase that is involved in protein transport. Involved in the transport of proteins or preproteins into chloroplast stroma (several ATPases may participate in this process).
