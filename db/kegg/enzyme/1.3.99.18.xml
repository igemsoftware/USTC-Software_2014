NAME        quinaldate 4-oxidoreductase;
            quinaldic acid 4-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     quinoline-2-carboxylate:acceptor 4-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating)
REACTION    quinaldate + acceptor + H2O = kynurenate + reduced acceptor [RN:R03687]
ALL_REAC    R03687
SUBSTRATE   quinaldate [CPD:C06325];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     kynurenate [CPD:C01717];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. AK2 also acts on quinoline-8-carboxylate, whereas that from Serratia marcescens 2CC-1 will oxidize nicotinate; quinaldate is a substrate for both of these enzymes. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonate, 1,4-benzoquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, nitroblue tetrazolium, thionine and menadione will serve as an electron acceptor for the former enzyme and ferricyanide for the latter; Meldola blue, iodonitrotetrazolium chloride, phenazine methosulfate, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and cytochrome c will act as electron acceptors for both.
