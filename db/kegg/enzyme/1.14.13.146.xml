NAME        taxoid 14beta-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     10beta-hydroxytaxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-yl-acetate,NADPH:oxygen 14-oxidoreductase
