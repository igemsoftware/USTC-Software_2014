SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase
REACTION    4'-demethylrebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-methionine = rebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [RN:R09569]
ALL_REAC    R09569
SUBSTRATE   4'-demethylrebeccamycin;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019]
PRODUCT     rebeccamycin [CPD:C19701];
            S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021]
COMMENT     Catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by the bacterium Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. The enzyme is able to use a wide variety substrates, tolerating variation on the imide heterocycle, deoxygenation of the sugar moiety, and even indolocarbazole glycoside anomers [1]. The enzyme is a member of the general acid/base-dependent O-methyltransferase family [2].
