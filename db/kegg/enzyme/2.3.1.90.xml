NAME        beta-glucogallin O-galloyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose:1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose O-galloyltransferase
REACTION    2 1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose = D-glucose + 1-O,6-O-digalloyl-beta-D-glucose [RN:R00049]
ALL_REAC    R00049
SUBSTRATE   1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose [CPD:C01158]
