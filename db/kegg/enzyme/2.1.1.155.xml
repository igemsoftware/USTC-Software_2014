SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:kaempferol 4'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + kaempferol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + kaempferide [RN:R06807]
ALL_REAC    R06807
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            kaempferol [CPD:C05903]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            kaempferide [CPD:C10098]
COMMENT     The enzyme acts on the hydroxy group in the 4'-position of some flavones, flavanones and isoflavones. Kaempferol, apigenin and kaempferol triglucoside are substrates, as is genistein, which reacts more slowly. Compounds with an hydroxy group in the 3' and 4' positions, such as quercetin and eriodictyol, do not act as substrates. Similar to EC 2.1.1.75, apigenin 4'-O-methyltransferase and EC 2.1.1.83, 3,7-dimethylquercetin 4'-O-methyltransferase.
