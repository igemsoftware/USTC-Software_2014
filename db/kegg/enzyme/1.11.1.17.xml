SYSNAME     glutathione amide:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase
REACTION    2 glutathione amide + H2O2 = glutathione amide disulfide + 2 H2O [RN:R09563]
ALL_REAC    R09563
SUBSTRATE   glutathione amide [CPD:C19689];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
PRODUCT     glutathione amide disulfide [CPD:C19690];

COMMENT     This enzyme, which has been characterized from the proteobacterium Marichromatium gracile, is a chimeric protein, containing a peroxiredoxin-like N-terminus and a glutaredoxin-like C terminus. The enzyme has peroxidase activity towards hydrogen peroxide and several small alkyl hydroperoxides, and is thought to represent an early adaptation for fighting oxidative stress [1]. The glutathione amide disulfide produced by this enzyme can be restored to glutathione amide by EC 1.8.1.16 (glutathione amide reductase).
