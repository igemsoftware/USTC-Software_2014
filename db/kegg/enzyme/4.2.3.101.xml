NAME        7-epi-sesquithujene synthase;
            TPS4-B73
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (7-epi-sesquithujene-forming)
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = 7-epi-sesquithujene + diphosphate [RN:R09901]
ALL_REAC    R09901
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     7-epi-sesquithujene [CPD:C20177];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Zea mays, variety B73, gives mainly 7-epi-sesquithujene with (S)-beta-bisabolene and traces of other sesquiterpenoids, cf. EC 4.2.3.55 (S)-beta-bisabolene synthase. It requires Mg2+ or Mn2+. The product ratio is dependent on which metal ion is present. 7-epi-Sesquithujene is an attractant for the emerald ash borer beetle.
