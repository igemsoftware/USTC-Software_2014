NAME        branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase;
            branched-chain oxo acid decarboxylase;
            branched-chain alpha-keto acid decarboxylase;
            branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase;
            BCKA;
            (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate carboxy-lyase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Carboxy-lyases
SYSNAME     (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate carboxy-lyase (2-methylbutanal-forming)
REACTION    (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate = 2-methylbutanal + CO2 [RN:R03894]
ALL_REAC    R03894
SUBSTRATE   (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate [CPD:C00671]
PRODUCT     2-methylbutanal [CPD:C02223];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     Acts on a number of 2-oxo acids, with a high affinity towards branched-chain substrates. The aldehyde formed may be enzyme-bound, and may be an intermediate in the bacterial system for the biosynthesis of branched-chain fatty acids.
