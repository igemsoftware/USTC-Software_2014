NAME        flavonol-3-O-triglucoside O-coumaroyltransferase;
            4-coumaroyl-CoA:flavonol-3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside] 6'''-O-4-coumaroyltransferase (incorrect)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     4-coumaroyl-CoA:flavonol 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside] 6'''-O-4-coumaroyltransferase
REACTION    4-coumaroyl-CoA + a flavonol 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside] = CoA + a flavonol 3-O-[6-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside]
