ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.80                 Enzyme
NAME        7-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase;
            7-DMATS
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:L-tryptophan 7-dimethylallyltransferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + L-tryptophan = diphosphate + 7-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan [RN:R09638]
ALL_REAC    R09638
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            L-tryptophan [CPD:C00078]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            7-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan [CPD:C19767]
COMMENT     This enzyme is more flexible towards the aromatic substrate than EC 2.5.1.34 (4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase), but similar to that enzyme, accepts only dimethylallyl diphosphate as the prenyl donor.
