ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.279                Enzyme
NAME        (R)-3-hydroxyacid-ester dehydrogenase;
            3-oxo ester (R)-reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     ethyl-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate:NADP+ 3-oxidoreductase
REACTION    ethyl (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate + NADP+ = ethyl 3-oxohexanoate + NADPH + H+ [RN:R04105]
ALL_REAC    R04105
SUBSTRATE   ethyl (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate [CPD:C03864];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     ethyl 3-oxohexanoate [CPD:C02975];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Also acts on ethyl (R)-3-oxobutanoate and some other (R)-3-hydroxy acid esters. The (R)- symbol is allotted on the assumption that no substituents change the order of priority from O-3 > C-2 > C-4. A subunit of yeast fatty acid synthase EC 2.3.1.86 fatty-acyl-CoA synthase). cf. EC 1.1.1.280 (S)-3-hydroxyacid ester dehydrogenase.
HISTORY     EC 1.1.1.279 created 1990 as EC 1.2.1.55, transferred 2003 to EC 1.1.1.279
