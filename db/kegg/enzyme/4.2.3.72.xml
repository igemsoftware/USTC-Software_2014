ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.72                 Enzyme
NAME        alpha-gurjunene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(-)-alpha-gurjunene-forming]
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = (-)-alpha-gurjunene + diphosphate [RN:R09606]
ALL_REAC    R09606
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     (-)-alpha-gurjunene [CPD:C19734];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Initial cyclization probably gives biyclogermacrene in an enzyme bound form which is not released to the medium. The enzyme from Solidago canadensis also forms a small amount of (+)-gamma-gurjunene [1].
