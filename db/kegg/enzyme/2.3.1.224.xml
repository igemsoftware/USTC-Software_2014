ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.224                Enzyme
NAME        acetyl-CoA-benzylalcohol acetyltransferase;
            BEAT
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol O-acetyltransferase
REACTION    (1) acetyl-CoA + benzyl alcohol = CoA + benzyl acetate [RN:R10473];
            (2) acetyl-CoA + cinnamyl alcohol = CoA + cinnamyl acetate [RN:R10474]
ALL_REAC    R10473 R10474
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            benzyl alcohol [CPD:C00556];
            cinnamyl alcohol [CPD:C02394]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            benzyl acetate [CPD:C15513];
            cinnamyl acetate [CPD:C12299]
COMMENT     The enzyme is found in flowers like Clarkia breweri, where it is important for floral scent production. Unlike EC 2.3.1.84, alcohol O-acetyltransferase, this enzyme is active with alcohols that contain a benzyl ring.
