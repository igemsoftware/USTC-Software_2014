NAME        4-hydroxycoumarin synthase;
            BIS2;
            BIS3
CLASS       Transferases;

            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     malonyl-CoA:2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA malonyltransferase
REACTION    malonyl-CoA + 2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA = 2 CoA + 4-hydroxycoumarin + CO2 [RN:R10173]
ALL_REAC    R10173
SUBSTRATE   malonyl-CoA [CPD:C00083];
            2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA [CPD:C20394]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            4-hydroxycoumarin [CPD:C20414];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     The enzyme, a polyketide synthase, can also accept benzoyl-CoA as substrate, which it condenses with 3 malonyl-CoA molecules to form 3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl (cf. EC 2.3.1.177, biphenyl synthase) [1].
