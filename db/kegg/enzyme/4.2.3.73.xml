ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.73                 Enzyme
NAME        valencene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (valencene-forming)
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = (+)-valencene + diphosphate [RN:R08691]
ALL_REAC    R08691
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     (+)-valencene [CPD:C17277];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The recombinant enzyme from Vitis vinifera gave 49.5% (+)-valencene and 35.5% (-)-7-epi-alpha-selinene. Initial cyclization gives (+)-germacrene A in an enzyme bound form which is not released to the medium.
