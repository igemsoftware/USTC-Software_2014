ENTRY       EC 1.14.11.28               Enzyme
NAME        proline 3-hydroxylase;
            P-3-H
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor
SYSNAME     L-proline,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO2 [RN:R09572]
ALL_REAC    R09572
SUBSTRATE   L-proline [CPD:C00148];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     cis-3-hydroxy-L-proline [CPD:C19706];
            succinate [CPD:C00042];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     Requires iron(II) for activity. Unlike the proline hydroxylases involved in collagen biosynthesis [EC 1.14.11.2 (procollagen-proline dioxygenase) and EC 1.14.11.7 (procollagen-proline 3-dioxygenase)], this enzyme does not require ascorbate for activity although it does increase the activity of the enzyme [2]. The enzyme is specific for L-proline as D-proline, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline and 3,4-dehydro-DL-proline are not substrates [2].
