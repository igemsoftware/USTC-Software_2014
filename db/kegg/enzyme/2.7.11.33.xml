NAME        [pyruvate, water dikinase] kinase;
            PSRP (ambiguous);
            PEPS kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Protein-serine/threonine kinases
SYSNAME     ADP:[pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphotransferase
REACTION    ADP + [pyruvate, water dikinase] = AMP + [pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate
SUBSTRATE   ADP [CPD:C00008];
            [pyruvate, water dikinase]
PRODUCT     AMP [CPD:C00020];
            [pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate
COMMENT     The enzyme from the bacterium Escherichia coli is bifunctional and catalyses both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of EC 2.7.9.2, pyruvate, water dikinase. cf. EC 2.7.4.28, ([pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate) phosphotransferase [1]. The enzyme is specific for a reaction intermediate form of EC 2.7.9.2, where it phosphorylates an active site histidine [1]. It has no activity toward EC 2.7.9.1 pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (cf. EC 2.7.11.32, [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] kinase).
