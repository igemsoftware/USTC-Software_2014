ENTRY       EC 1.14.21.3                Enzyme
NAME        berbamunine synthase;
            (S)-N-methylcoclaurine oxidase (C-O phenol-coupling)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated
SYSNAME     (S)-N-methylcoclaurine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-O phenol-coupling)
REACTION    (S)-N-methylcoclaurine + (R)-N-methylcoclaurine + NADPH + H+ + O2 = berbamunine + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R04694]
ALL_REAC    R04694;
            (other) R05210 R05215
SUBSTRATE   (S)-N-methylcoclaurine [CPD:C05176];
            (R)-N-methylcoclaurine [CPD:C05243];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     berbamunine [CPD:C05177];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450). Forms the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid berbamunine by phenol oxidation of N-methylcoclaurine without the incorporation of oxygen into the product. Reaction of two molecules of (R)-N-methylcoclaurine gives the dimer guattagaumerine.
