SYSNAME     2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate D-glyceraldehyde-lyase (pyruvate-forming)
REACTION    2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate = pyruvate + D-glyceraldehyde [RN:R08570]

SUBSTRATE   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate [CPD:C00204]
PRODUCT     pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            D-glyceraldehyde [CPD:C00577]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the archaeon Picrophilus torridus is involved in D-glucose and D-galactose catabolism via the nonphosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In the direction of aldol synthesis the enzyme catalyses the formation of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate at a similar ratio. It shows no activity with 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-phosphate. cf. EC 4.1.2.14, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase.
