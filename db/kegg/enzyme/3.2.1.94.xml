NAME        glucan 1,6-alpha-isomaltosidase;
            exo-isomaltohydrolase;
            isomalto-dextranase;
            isomaltodextranase;
            G2-dextranase;
            1,6-alpha-D-glucan isomaltohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     6-alpha-D-glucan isomaltohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides, to remove successive isomaltose units from the non-reducing ends of the chains
COMMENT     Optimum activity is on those 1,6-alpha-D-glucans containing 6, 7 and 8 glucose units; those containing 3, 4 and 5 glucose units are hydrolysed at slower rates.
