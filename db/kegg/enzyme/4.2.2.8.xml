            Acting on polysaccharides
SYSNAME     heparin-sulfate lyase
REACTION    Elimination of sulfate; appears to act on linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and uronate. Product is an unsaturated sugar.
COMMENT     Does not act on N,O-desulfated glucosamine or N-acetyl-O-sulfated glucosamine linkages.
