ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.143                Enzyme
NAME        diphosphate-purine nucleoside kinase;
            pyrophosphate-purine nucleoside kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     diphosphate:purine nucleoside phosphotransferase
REACTION    diphosphate + a purine nucleoside = phosphate + a purine mononucleotide [RN:R03699]
ALL_REAC    R03699
SUBSTRATE   diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            purine nucleoside [CPD:C15586]
PRODUCT     phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            purine mononucleotide [CPD:C05325]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the Acholeplasma class of Mollicutes catalyses the conversion of adenosine, guanosine and inosine to AMP, GMP and IMP. ATP cannot substitute for diphosphate as a substrate.
