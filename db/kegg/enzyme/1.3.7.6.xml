ENTRY       EC 1.3.7.6                  Enzyme
NAME        phycoerythrobilin synthase;
            PebS
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor
SYSNAME     (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (from biliverdin IXalpha)
REACTION    (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin + 2 oxidized ferredoxin = biliverdin IXalpha + 2 reduced ferredoxin [RN:R09491]
ALL_REAC    R09491
SUBSTRATE   (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin [CPD:C05912];
            oxidized ferredoxin [CPD:C00139]
PRODUCT     biliverdin IXalpha;
            reduced ferredoxin [CPD:C00138]
COMMENT     This enzyme, from a cyanophage infecting oceanic cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus genus, uses a four-electron reduction to carry out the reactions catalysed by EC 1.3.7.2 (15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and EC 1.3.7.3 (phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase). 15,16-Dihydrobiliverdin is formed as a bound intermediate. Free 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin can also act as a substrate to form phycoerythrobilin.
