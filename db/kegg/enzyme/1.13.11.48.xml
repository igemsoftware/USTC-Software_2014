ENTRY       EC 1.13.11.48               Enzyme
NAME        3-hydroxy-2-methylquinolin-4-one 2,4-dioxygenase;
            (1H)-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1H-quinolin-4-one 2,4-dioxygenase (CO-forming)
REACTION    3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1H-quinolin-4-one + O2 = N-acetylanthranilate + CO [RN:R05720]
ALL_REAC    R05720;
            (other) R05155
SUBSTRATE   3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1H-quinolin-4-one [CPD:C11504];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     N-acetylanthranilate [CPD:C06332];
            CO [CPD:C00237]
COMMENT     Does not contain a metal centre or organic cofactor. Fission of two C-C bonds: 2,4-dioxygenolytic cleavage with concomitant release of carbon monoxide. The enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. can also act on 3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline, forming N-formylanthranilate and CO (cf. EC 1.13.11.47, 3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase), but more slowly.
