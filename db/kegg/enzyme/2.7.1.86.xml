ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.86                 Enzyme
NAME        NADH kinase;
            reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (phosphorylating);
            DPNH kinase;
            reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide kinase;
            NADH kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:NADH 2'-phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + NADH = ADP + NADPH [RN:R00105]
ALL_REAC    R00105
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            NADH [CPD:C00004]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005]
COMMENT     CTP, ITP, UTP and GTP can also act as phosphate donors (in decreasing order of activity). The enzyme is specific for NADH. Activated by acetate.
