NAME        1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol-forming);
            1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (ambiguous);
            AFR
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol + NADP+ = 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose + NADPH + H+ [RN:R08194]
ALL_REAC    R08194
SUBSTRATE   1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol [CPD:C16538];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     1,5-anhydro-D-fructose [CPD:C06485];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     This enzyme is present in some but not all Rhizobium species and belongs in the GFO/IDH/MocA protein family [2]. This enzyme differs from hepatic 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase, which yields 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol as the product (see EC 1.1.1.263). In Sinorhizobium morelense, the product of the reaction, 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol, can be further metabolized to D-mannose [1]. The enzyme also reduces 1,5-anhydro-D-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose and 2-ketoaldoses (called osones), such as D-glucosone (D-arabino-hexos-2-ulose) and 6-deoxy-D-glucosone. It does not reduce common aldoses and ketoses, or non-sugar aldehydes and ketones [1].
