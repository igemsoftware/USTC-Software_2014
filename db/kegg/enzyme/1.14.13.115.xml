ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.115              Enzyme
NAME        angelicin synthase;
            CYP71AJ4 (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (+)-columbianetin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    (+)-columbianetin + NADPH + H+ + O2 = angelicin + NADP+ + acetone + 2 H2O [RN:R09002]
ALL_REAC    R09002
SUBSTRATE   (+)-columbianetin [CPD:C19707];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     angelicin [CPD:C09060];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
