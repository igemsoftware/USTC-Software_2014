ENTRY       EC 1.4.3.20                 Enzyme
NAME        L-lysine 6-oxidase;
            L-lysine-epsilon-oxidase;
            Lod;
            LodA;
            marinocine
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     L-lysine:oxygen 6-oxidoreductase (deaminating)
REACTION    L-lysine + O2 + H2O = (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate + H2O2 + NH3 [RN:R07598]
ALL_REAC    R07598
SUBSTRATE   L-lysine [CPD:C00047];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate [CPD:C04076];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     Differs from EC 1.4.3.13, protein-lysine 6-oxidase, by using free L-lysine rather than the protein-bound form. N2-Acetyl-L-lysine is also a substrate, but N6-acetyl-L-lysine, which has an acetyl group at position 6, is not a substrate. Also acts on L-ornithine, D-lysine and 4-hydroxy-L-lysine, but more slowly. The amines cadaverine and putrescine are not substrates [2].
