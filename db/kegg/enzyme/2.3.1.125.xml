ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.125                Enzyme
NAME        1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol O-acyltransferase;
            1-hexadecyl-2-acetylglycerol acyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol O-acyltransferase
REACTION    acyl-CoA + 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol = CoA + 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-3-acyl-sn-glycerol [RN:R04363]
ALL_REAC    R04363
SUBSTRATE   acyl-CoA [CPD:C00040];
            1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol [CPD:C03820]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-3-acyl-sn-glycerol [CPD:C04361]
COMMENT     A number of acyl-CoAs can act as acyl donor; maximum activity is obtained with linoleoyl-CoA. Not identical with EC 2.3.1.20 diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase.
