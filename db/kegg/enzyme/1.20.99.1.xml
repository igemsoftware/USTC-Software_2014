ENTRY       EC 1.20.99.1                Enzyme
NAME        arsenate reductase (donor);
            arsenate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     arsenate:acceptor oxidoreductase
REACTION    arsenite + acceptor = arsenate + reduced acceptor [RN:R05752]
ALL_REAC    R05752
SUBSTRATE   arsenite [CPD:C06697];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     arsenate [CPD:C11215];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     Benzyl viologen can act as an acceptor. Unlike EC 1.20.4.1, arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin), reduced glutaredoxin cannot serve as a reductant.
HISTORY     EC 1.20.99.1 created 2000 as EC 1.97.1.6, transferred 2001 to EC 1.20.99.1
