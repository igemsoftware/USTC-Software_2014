ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.75                 Enzyme
NAME        apigenin 4'-O-methyltransferase;
            flavonoid O-methyltransferase;
            flavonoid methyltransferase;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone 4'-O-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:apigenin 4'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + apigenin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + acacetin [RN:R03571]
ALL_REAC    R03571
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            apigenin [CPD:C01477]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            acacetin [CPD:C01470]
COMMENT     Converts apigenin into acacetin. Naringenin can also act as an acceptor, but more slowly.
