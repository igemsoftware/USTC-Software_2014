ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.50                 Enzyme
NAME        zeatin 9-aminocarboxyethyltransferase;
            beta-(9-cytokinin)-alanine synthase;
            beta-(9-cytokinin)alanine synthase;
            O-acetyl-L-serine acetate-lyase (adding N6-substituted adenine);
            lupinate synthetase;
            lupinic acid synthase;
            lupinic acid synthetase;
            3-O-acetyl-L-serine:zeatin 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     O-acetyl-L-serine:zeatin 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase
REACTION    O-acetyl-L-serine + zeatin = lupinate + acetate [RN:R03133]
ALL_REAC    R03133
SUBSTRATE   O-acetyl-L-serine [CPD:C00979];
            zeatin [CPD:C00371]
PRODUCT     lupinate [CPD:C01513];
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     The enzyme acts not only on zeatin but also on other N6-substituted adenines. The reaction destroys their cytokinin activity and forms the corresponding 3-(adenin-9-yl)-L-alanine.
