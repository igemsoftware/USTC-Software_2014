ENTRY       EC 2.8.3.11                 Enzyme
NAME        citramalate CoA-transferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            CoA-transferases
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:citramalate CoA-transferase
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + citramalate = acetate + (3S)-citramalyl-CoA [RN:R02955]
ALL_REAC    R02955 > R03153
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            citramalate [CPD:C00815]
PRODUCT     acetate [CPD:C00033];
            (3S)-citramalyl-CoA [CPD:C01011]
COMMENT     The enzyme is a component of EC 4.1.3.22 citramalate lyase. Also catalyses the transfer of thioacyl carrier protein from its acetyl thioester to citramalate.
