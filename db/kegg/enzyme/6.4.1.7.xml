SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            HCO3- [CPD:C00288]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];

COMMENT     A biotin-containing enzyme that requires Mg2+ for activity. It was originally thought [1] that this enzyme was a promoting factor for the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate by EC 1.1.1.41, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+), but this has since been disproved [2]. The product of the reaction is unstable and is quickly converted into isocitrate by the action of EC 1.1.1.41 [2].
