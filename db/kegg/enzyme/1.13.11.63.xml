ENTRY       EC 1.13.11.63               Enzyme
NAME        beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase;
            blh (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     beta-carotene:oxygen 15,15'-dioxygenase (bond-cleaving)
REACTION    beta-carotene + O2 = 2 all-trans-retinal [RN:R00032]
ALL_REAC    R00032
SUBSTRATE   beta-carotene [CPD:C02094];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     all-trans-retinal [CPD:C00376]
COMMENT     Requires Fe2+. The enzyme, which has been characterized from the uncultured marine bacterium 66A03, is involved in the proteorhodopsin system, which uses retinal as its chromophore. The enzyme cleaves beta-carotene symmetrically, producing two molecules of all-trans-retinal. Both atoms of the oxygen molecule are incorporated into the products. It requires a substrate greater than C35 that contains at least one unsubstituted beta-end group. cf. EC 1.14.99.36, beta-carotene 15,15-monooxygenase.
