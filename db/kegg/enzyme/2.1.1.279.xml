SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:trans-anol O-methyltransferase
REACTION    (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + trans-anol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + trans-anethole [RN:R10252];
            (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + isoeugenol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + isomethyleugenol [RN:R07240]

SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            trans-anol [CPD:C20464];
            isoeugenol [CPD:C10469]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            trans-anethole [CPD:C10428];
            isomethyleugenol [CPD:C10478]
COMMENT     The enzyme from anise (Pimpinella anisum) is highly specific for substrates in which the double bond in the propenyl side chain is located between C7 and C8, and, in contrast to EC 2.1.1.146, (iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase, does not have activity with eugenol or chavicol.
