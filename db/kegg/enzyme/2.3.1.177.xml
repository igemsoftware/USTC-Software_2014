NAME        3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl synthase;
            BIS1;
            biphenyl synthase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;

            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     malonyl-CoA:benzoyl-CoA malonyltransferase
REACTION    3 malonyl-CoA + benzoyl-CoA = 4 CoA + 3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl + 4 CO2 [RN:R09621]
ALL_REAC    R09621
SUBSTRATE   malonyl-CoA [CPD:C00083];
            benzoyl-CoA [CPD:C00512]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl [CPD:C19750];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     A polyketide synthase that is involved in the production of the phytoalexin aucuparin. 2-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA can also act as substrate but it leads to the derailment product 4-hydroxycoumarin (cf. EC 2.3.1.208, 4-hydroxycoumarin synthase) [2]. This enzyme uses the same starter substrate as EC 2.3.1.151, benzophenone synthase.
