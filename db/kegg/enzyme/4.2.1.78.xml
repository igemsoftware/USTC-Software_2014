ENTRY       EC 4.2.1.78                 Enzyme
NAME        (S)-norcoclaurine synthase;
            (S)-norlaudanosoline synthase;
            4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde hydro-lyase (adding dopamine)
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Hydro-lyases
SYSNAME     4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde hydro-lyase [adding dopamine; (S)-norcoclaurine-forming]
REACTION    4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde + dopamine = (S)-norcoclaurine + H2O [RN:R04305]
ALL_REAC    R04305;
            (other) R04084
SUBSTRATE   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde [CPD:C03765];
            dopamine [CPD:C03758]
PRODUCT     (S)-norcoclaurine [CPD:C06160];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The reaction makes a six-membered ring by forming a bond between C-6 of the 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl group of the dopamine and C-1 of the aldehyde in the imine formed between the substrates. The product is the precursor of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in plants. The enzyme, formerly known as (S)-norlaudanosoline synthase, will also catalyse the reaction of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol + (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form (S)-norlaudanosoline, but this alkaloid has not been found to occur in plants.
