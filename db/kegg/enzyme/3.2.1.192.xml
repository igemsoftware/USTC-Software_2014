NAME        ginsenoside Rb1 beta-glucosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     ginsenoside Rb1 glucohydrolase
REACTION    ginsenoside Rb1 + 2 H2O = ginsenoside Rg3 + 2 D-glucopyranose (overall reaction);
            (1a) ginsenoside Rb1 + H2O = ginsenoside Rd + D-glucopyranose;
            (1b) ginsenoside Rd + H2O = ginsenoside Rg3 + D-glucopyranose
SUBSTRATE   ginsenoside Rb1 [CPD:C20713];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            ginsenoside Rd [CPD:C20725]
PRODUCT     ginsenoside Rg3 [CPD:C20778];
            D-glucopyranose [CPD:C00031];
            ginsenoside Rd [CPD:C20725]
COMMENT     Ginsenosidases catalyse the hydrolysis of glycosyl moieties attached to the C-3, C-6 or C-20 position of ginsenosides. They are specific with respect to the nature of the glycosidic linkage, the position and the order in which the linkages are cleaved. Ginsenoside Rb1 beta-glucosidase specifically and sequentially hydrolyses the 20-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D glucopyranosyloxy] residues attached to position 20 by first hydrolysing the (1->6)-glucosidic bond to generate ginsenoside Rd as an intermediate, followed by hydrolysis of the remaining 20-O-beta-D-glucosidic bond.
