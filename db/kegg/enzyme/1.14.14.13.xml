CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With reduced flavin or flavoprotein as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein],FMNH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating)
REACTION    4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein] + FMNH2 + O2 = 4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)-(2S)-2-hydroxybutanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein] + FMN + H2O [RN:R08908]

SUBSTRATE   4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein];
            FMNH2 [CPD:C01847];

PRODUCT     4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)-(2S)-2-hydroxybutanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein];
            FMN [CPD:C00061];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of the side chain of the aminoglycoside antibiotics of the butirosin family. FMNH2 is used as a free cofactor. Forms a complex with a dedicated NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase. The enzyme is not able to hydroxylate free substrates, activation by the acyl-carrier protein is mandatory.
            Octanoyl-S-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein] is also accepted.
