ENTRY       EC 1.13.11.43               Enzyme
NAME        lignostilbene alphabeta-dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene:oxygen oxidoreductase (alphabeta-bond-cleaving)
REACTION    1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene + O2 = 2 vanillin [RN:R00043]
ALL_REAC    R00043
SUBSTRATE   1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene [CPD:C04547];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     vanillin [CPD:C00755]
COMMENT     An iron protein. The enzyme catalyses oxidative cleavage of the interphenyl double bond in the synthetic substrate and lignin-derived stilbenes. It is responsible for the degradation of a diarylpropane-type structure in lignin.
