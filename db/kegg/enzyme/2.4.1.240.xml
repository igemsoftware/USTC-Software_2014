COMMENT     One of three specific glucosyltransferases in pea (Pisum sativum) thatsuccessively add a beta-D-glucosyl group first to O-3 of kaempferol, and then to O-2 of the previously added glucosyl group giving the 3-O-sophoroside and then the 3-O-sophorotrioside (see also EC 2.4.1.91 flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase, and EC 2.4.1.239 flavonol-3-O-glucoside glucosyltransferase).
