NAME        L-evernosamine nitrososynthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     dTDP-beta-L-evernosamine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating)
REACTION    dTDP-beta-L-evernosamine + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 2 O2 = dTDP-2,3,6-trideoxy-3-C-methyl-4-O-methyl-3-nitroso-beta-L-arabino-hexopyranose + 2 NADP+ + 3 H2O (overall reaction) [RN:R10664];
            (1a) dTDP-beta-L-evernosamine + NADPH + H+ + O2 = dTDP-N-hydroxy-beta-L-evernosamine + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R10662];
            (1b) dTDP-N-hydroxy-beta-L-evernosamine + NADPH + H+ + O2 = dTDP-2,3,6-trideoxy-3-C-methyl-4-O-methyl-3-nitroso-beta-L-arabino-hexopyranose + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R10663]

PRODUCT     dTDP-2,3,6-trideoxy-3-C-methyl-4-O-methyl-3-nitroso-beta-L-arabino-hexopyranose [CPD:C20767];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            dTDP-N-hydroxy-beta-L-evernosamine [CPD:C20766]
COMMENT     Requires FAD. Isolated from the bacterium Micromonospora carbonacea var. africana. The nitroso group is probably spontaneously oxidized to a nitro group giving dTDP-beta-L-evernitrose, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic everninomycin. The reaction was studied using dTDP-beta-L-4-epi-vancosamine (dTDP-4-O-desmethyl-beta-L-evernitrosamine).
