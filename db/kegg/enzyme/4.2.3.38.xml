NAME        alpha-bisabolene synthase;
            bisabolene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(E)-alpha-bisabolene-forming]
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = (E)-alpha-bisabolene + diphosphate [RN:R08370]
ALL_REAC    R08370
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     (E)-alpha-bisabolene [CPD:C19749];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     This cytosolic sesquiterpenoid synthase requires a divalent cation cofactor (Mg2+ or, to a lesser extent, Mn2+) to neutralize the negative charge of the diphosphate leaving group. While unlikely to encounter geranyl diphosphate (GDP) in vivo as it is localized to plastids, the enzyme can use GDP as a substrate in vitro to produce (+)-(4R)-limonene [cf. EC 4.2.3.20, (R)-limonene synthase]. The enzyme is induced as part of a defense mechanism in the grand fir Abies grandis as a response to stem wounding.
