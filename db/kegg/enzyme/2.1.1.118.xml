ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.118                Enzyme
NAME        columbamine O-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:columbamine O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + columbamine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + palmatine [RN:R03721]
ALL_REAC    R03721
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            columbamine [CPD:C01795]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            palmatine [CPD:C05315]
COMMENT     The product of this reaction is a protoberberine alkaloid that is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. This enzyme is distinct in specificity from EC 2.1.1.88, 8-hydroxyquercetin 8-O-methyltransferase.
