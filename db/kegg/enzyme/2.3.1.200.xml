NAME        lipoyl amidotransferase;
            LipL (gene name, ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     [glycine cleavage system H]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine:[lipoyl-carrier protein]-N6-L-lysine lipoyltransferase
REACTION    [glycine cleavage system H]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine + a [lipoyl-carrier protein] = glycine cleavage system H + a [lipoyl-carrier protein]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine
SUBSTRATE   [glycine cleavage system H]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine;
            [lipoyl-carrier protein]
PRODUCT     glycine cleavage system H;
            [lipoyl-carrier protein]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine
COMMENT     In the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes the enzyme takes part in a pathway for scavenging of lipoic acid. The enzyme is bound to 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenases such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, where it transfers the lipoyl moiety from lipoyl-[glycine cleavage system H] to the E2 subunits of the complexes.
