ENTRY       EC 1.20.4.2                 Enzyme
NAME        methylarsonate reductase;
            MMA(V) reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donors;
            With disulfide as acceptor
SYSNAME     gluthathione:methylarsonate oxidoreductase
REACTION    methylarsonate + 2 glutathione = methylarsonite + glutathione disulfide + H2O [RN:R05748]
ALL_REAC    R05748
SUBSTRATE   methylarsonate [CPD:C07294];
            glutathione [CPD:C00051]
