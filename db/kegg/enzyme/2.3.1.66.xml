ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.66                 Enzyme
NAME        leucine N-acetyltransferase;
            leucine acetyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:L-leucine N-acetyltransferase
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + L-leucine = CoA + N-acetyl-L-leucine [RN:R01089]
ALL_REAC    R01089
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            L-leucine [CPD:C00123]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            N-acetyl-L-leucine [CPD:C02710]
COMMENT     Propanoyl-CoA can act as a donor, but more slowly. L-Arginine, L-valine, L-phenylalanine and peptides containing L-leucine can act as acceptors.
