ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.62                 Enzyme
NAME        phosphoramidate---hexose phosphotransferase;
            phosphoramidate-hexose transphosphorylase;
            phosphoramidic-hexose transphosphorylase;
            phosphoramidate:hexose 1-phosphotransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     phosphoramidate:D-hexose 1-phosphotransferase
REACTION    phosphoramidate + D-hexose = NH3 + alpha-D-hexose 1-phosphate [RN:R03148]
ALL_REAC    R03148 > R08514
SUBSTRATE   phosphoramidate [CPD:C02306];
            D-hexose [CPD:C00738]
PRODUCT     NH3 [CPD:C00014];
            alpha-D-hexose 1-phosphate [CPD:C01171]
COMMENT     Activity is observed with several hexoses; of these glucose is the best substrate and the product from it is alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate. The phosphoramidate donor can be replaced by N-phosphoglycine and by an N-phosphohistidine. May be identical with EC 3.1.3.9 glucose-6-phosphatase.
