CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Cleaves the (Ser/Thr)-Xaa-Ala!(Ser/Ala)-Gly motif in the polyprotein NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus at the pVP2-VP4 and VP4-VP3 junctions
COMMENT     Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a birnavirus that causes an acute, contagious disease in young salmonid fish [2]. As with most viruses that infect eukaryotic cells, the proteolytic processing of viral precursor proteins is a crucial step in the life cycle of this virus [2]. pVP2 is converted into VP2 by cleavage near the carboxy end of pVP2. This cleavage is most likely due to host-cell proteases rather than VP4 [2,3]. Differs from most serine peptidases in not having the catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp [2]. Belongs in peptidase family S50.
