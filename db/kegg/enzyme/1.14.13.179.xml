NAME        methylxanthine N3-demethylase;
            ndmB (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     theobromine:oxygen oxidoreductase (N3-demethylating)
REACTION    (1) theobromine + O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ = 7-methylxanthine + NAD(P)+ + H2O + formaldehyde [RN:R07961 R07962];
            (2) 3-methylxanthine + O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ = xanthine + NAD(P)+ + H2O + formaldehyde [RN:R07967 R07968]

COMMENT     A non-heme iron oxygenase. The enzyme from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida shares an NAD(P)H-FMN reductase subunit with EC 1.14.13.178, methylxanthine N1-demethylase, and has higher activity with NADH than with NADPH [1]. Also demethylates caffeine and theophylline with lower efficiency. Forms part of the degradation pathway of methylxanthines.
