NAME        citrate synthase (unknown stereospecificity);
            citrate condensing enzyme;
            CoA-acetylating citrate oxaloacetate-lyase;
            citrate synthetase;
            citric synthase;
            citric-condensing enzyme;
            citrogenase;
            condensing enzyme;
            oxaloacetate transacetase;
            oxalacetic transacetase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Acyl groups converted into alkyl groups on transfer
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-acetyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing)
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + H2O + oxaloacetate = citrate + CoA
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036]
PRODUCT     citrate [CPD:C00158];
            CoA [CPD:C00010]
COMMENT     This entry has been included to accommodate those citrate synthases for which the stereospecificity with respect to C2 of oxaloacetate has not been established [cf. EC 2.3.3.1, citrate (Si)-synthase and EC 2.3.3.3, citrate (Re)-synthase].
