ENTRY       EC 2.7.4.28                 Enzyme
NAME        [pyruvate, water dikinase]-phosphate phosphotransferase;
            PSRP (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
SYSNAME     [pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate:phosphate phosphotransferase
REACTION    [pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate + phosphate = [pyruvate, water dikinase] + diphosphate
SUBSTRATE   [pyruvate, water dikinase] phosphate;
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     [pyruvate, water dikinase];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the bacterium Escherichia coli is bifunctional and catalyses both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of EC 2.7.9.2, pyruvate, water dikinase. cf. EC 2.7.11.33, [pyruvate, water dikinase] kinase [1].
