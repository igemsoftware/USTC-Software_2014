NAME        2-oxoglutarate/L-arginine monooxygenase/decarboxylase (succinate-forming);
            ethylene-forming enzyme;
            EFE
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor
SYSNAME     L-arginine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (succinate-forming)
REACTION    2-oxoglutarate + L-arginine + O2 = succinate + CO2 + guanidine + (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate + H2O (overall reaction) [RN:R09785];
            (1a) 2-oxoglutarate + L-arginine + O2 = succinate + CO2 + L-hydroxyarginine [RN:R10081];
            (1b) L-hydroxyarginine = guanidine + (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate + H2O [RN:R10082]

            L-hydroxyarginine [CPD:C20330]
PRODUCT     succinate [CPD:C00042];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            guanidine [CPD:C17349];
            (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate [CPD:C03912];

            L-hydroxyarginine [CPD:C20330]
COMMENT     This is one of two simultaneous reactions catalysed by the enzyme, which is responsible for ethylene production in bacteria of the Pseudomonas syringae group.
            In the other reaction [EC 1.13.12.19, 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (ethylene-forming)] the enzyme catalyses the dioxygenation of 2-oxoglutarate forming ethylene and three molecules of carbon dioxide.
            The enzyme catalyses two cycles of the ethylene-forming reaction for each cycle of the succinate-forming reaction, so that the stoichiometry of the products ethylene and succinate is 2:1.
