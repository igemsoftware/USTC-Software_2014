SYSNAME     O3-acetyl-L-serine:isoxazolin-5-one 2-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)transferase
REACTION    O3-acetyl-L-serine + isoxazolin-5-one = 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-2-yl)-L-alanine + acetate
SUBSTRATE   O3-acetyl-L-serine [CPD:C00979];
            isoxazolin-5-one
PRODUCT     3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-2-yl)-L-alanine;
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the plants Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea) and L. sativus (grass pea) also forms 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine in vitro (cf. EC 2.5.1.119). However, only 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-2-yl)-L-alanine is formed in vivo. 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-2-yl)-L-alanine is the biosynthetic precursor of the neurotoxin N3-oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid, the cause of lathyrism. Closely related and possibly identical to EC 2.5.1.47, cysteine synthase, and EC 2.5.1.51, beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase.
