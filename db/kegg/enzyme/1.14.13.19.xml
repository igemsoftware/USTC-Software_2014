NAME        taxifolin 8-monooxygenase;
            taxifolin hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     taxifolin,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating)
REACTION    taxifolin + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = 2,3-dihydrogossypetin + NAD(P)+ + H2O [RN:R03637 R03638]
ALL_REAC    R03637 R03638
SUBSTRATE   taxifolin [CPD:C01617];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2,3-dihydrogossypetin [CPD:C03052];
