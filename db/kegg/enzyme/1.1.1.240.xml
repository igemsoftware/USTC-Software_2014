ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.240                Enzyme
NAME        N-acetylhexosamine 1-dehydrogenase;
            N-acetylhexosamine dehydrogenase;
            N-acetyl-D-hexosamine dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     N-acetyl-D-hexosamine:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase
REACTION    N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine + NAD+ = N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate + NADH + H+ [RN:R01202]
ALL_REAC    R01202
SUBSTRATE   N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine [CPD:C20328];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate [CPD:C01133];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Also acts on N-acetylgalactosamine and, more slowly, on N-acetylmannosamine. Anomeric specificity was tested with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and it was shown that the enzyme is specific for the alpha anomer.
