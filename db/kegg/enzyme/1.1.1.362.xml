ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.362                Enzyme
NAME        aklaviketone reductase;
            dauE (gene name);
            aknU (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     aklavinone:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    aklavinone + NADP+ = aklaviketone + NADPH + H+ [RN:R06682]
ALL_REAC    R06682
SUBSTRATE   aklavinone [CPD:C12424];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     aklaviketone [CPD:C12423];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the synthesis of the aklavinone aglycone, a common precursor for several anthracycline antibiotics including aclacinomycins, daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The enzyme from the Gram-negative bacterium Streptomyces sp. C5 produces daunomycin.
