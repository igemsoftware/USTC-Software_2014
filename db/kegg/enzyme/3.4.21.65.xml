ENTRY       EC 3.4.21.65                Enzyme
NAME        thermomycolin;
            thermomycolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Rather nonspecific hydrolysis of proteins. Preferential cleavage: Ala!, Tyr!, Phe! in small molecule substrates
COMMENT     A peptidase of family S8 (subtilisin family) from the thermophilic fungus Malbranchea pulchella var. sulfurea containing Cys, but not inhibited by p-mercuribenzoate. Very thermostable. Formerly included in EC 3.4.21.14
HISTORY     EC 3.4.21.65 created 1992 (EC 3.4.21.14 created 1961 as EC 3.4.4.16, transferred 1972 to EC 3.4.21.14, modified 1986, part incorporated 1992)
