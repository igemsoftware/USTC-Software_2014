ENTRY       EC 1.14.21.1                Enzyme
NAME        (S)-stylopine synthase;
            (S)-cheilanthifoline oxidase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated
SYSNAME     (S)-cheilanthifoline,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
REACTION    (S)-cheilanthifoline + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (S)-stylopine + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R04690]
ALL_REAC    R04690
SUBSTRATE   (S)-cheilanthifoline [CPD:C05174];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (S)-stylopine [CPD:C05175];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450) catalysing an oxidative reaction that does not incorporate oxygen into the product. Forms the second methylenedioxy bridge of the protoberberine alkaloid stylopine from oxidative ring closure of adjacent phenolic and methoxy groups of cheilanthifoline.
