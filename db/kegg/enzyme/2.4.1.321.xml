ENTRY       EC 2.4.1.321                Enzyme
NAME        cellobionic acid phosphorylase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-gluconate:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-gluconate + phosphate = alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + D-gluconate
SUBSTRATE   4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-gluconate;
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00103];
            D-gluconate [CPD:C00257]
COMMENT     The enzyme occurs in cellulolytic bacteria and fungi. It catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis of cellobionic acid. In the synthetic direction it produces 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucuronate from alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and D-glucuronate with low activity
