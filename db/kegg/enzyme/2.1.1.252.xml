SYSNAME     tetramethylammonium:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase
REACTION    tetramethylammonium + a [Co(I) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] = a [methyl-Co(III) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] + trimethylamine [RN:R10017]
ALL_REAC    R10017
SUBSTRATE   tetramethylammonium [CPD:C20292];
            [Co(I) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein]
PRODUCT     [methyl-Co(III) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein];
            trimethylamine [CPD:C00565]
COMMENT     The enzyme, which catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from tetramethylammonium to a tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein (MtqC), is involved in methanogenesis from tetramethylammonium. Methylation of the corrinoid protein requires the central cobalt to be in the Co(I) state. During methylation the cobalt is oxidized to the Co(III) state. The methylated corrinoid protein is substrate for EC 2.1.1.253, methylated tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase.
