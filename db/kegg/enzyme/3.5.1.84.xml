NAME        biuret amidohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In linear amides
SYSNAME     biuret amidohydrolase
REACTION    biuret + H2O = urea-1-carboxylate + NH3 [RN:R05563]
ALL_REAC    R05563;
            (other) R05562
SUBSTRATE   biuret [CPD:C06555];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     urea-1-carboxylate [CPD:C01010];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     Along with EC 3.5.2.15 (cyanuric acid amidohydrolase) and EC 3.5.1.54 (allophanate hydrolase), this enzyme forms part of the cyanuric-acid metabolism pathway, which degrades s-triazide herbicides, such as atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-1,3,5-triazine], in bacteria. Urea-1-carboxylate rather than urea (as was thought previously) is the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric-acid metabolism in bacteria [2]. The product, urea-1-carboxylate, can spontaneously decarboxylate under acidic conditions to form urea but, under physiological conditions, it can be converted into CO2 and ammonia by the action of EC 3.5.1.54 [2].
