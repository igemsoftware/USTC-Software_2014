NAME        2-methylcitrate dehydratase (2-methyl-trans-aconitate forming)
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Hydro-lyases
SYSNAME     (2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase (2-methyl-trans-aconitate forming)
REACTION    (2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate = 2-methyl-trans-aconitate + H2O
SUBSTRATE   (2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate
PRODUCT     2-methyl-trans-aconitate;
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Catalyses the dehydration of (2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate, forming the trans isomer of 2-methyl-aconitate (unlike EC 4.2.1.79, which forms only the cis isomer). Part of a propionate degradation pathway. The enzyme from Shewanella oneidensis can also accept citrate and cis-aconitate, but activity with (2S,3S)-2-methylcitrate was approximately 2.5-fold higher. 2-methylisocitrate and isocitrate were not substrates [1]. An iron-sulfur protein.
