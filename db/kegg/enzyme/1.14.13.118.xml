COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). This enzyme catalyses two successive N-hydroxylations of L-valine, the first committed steps in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside linamarin in Manihot esculenta (cassava). The product of the two hydroxylations, N,N-dihydroxy-L-valine, is extremely labile and dehydrates spontaneously. The dehydrated product is then subject to a decarboxylation that produces the oxime. It is still not known whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalysed by the enzyme. The product, (E)-2-methylpropanal oxime, undergoes a spontaneous isomerization to the (Z) form. The enzyme can also accept L-isoleucine as substrate, with a lower activity. It is different from EC 1.14.13.117 (isoleucine N-monooxygenase), which prefers L-isoleucine.
