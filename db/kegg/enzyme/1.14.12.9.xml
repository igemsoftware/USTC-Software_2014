ENTRY       EC 1.14.12.9                Enzyme
NAME        4-chlorophenylacetate 3,4-dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-chlorophenylacetate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3,4-hydroxylating, dechlorinating)
REACTION    4-chlorophenylacetate + NADH + H+ + O2 = 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate + chloride + NAD+ [RN:R03306]
ALL_REAC    R03306
SUBSTRATE   4-chlorophenylacetate [CPD:C03077];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate [CPD:C01161];
            chloride [CPD:C00698];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
COMMENT     A system, containing a reductase and an iron-sulfur oxygenase, and no independent ferredoxin. Requires Fe2+. Also acts on 4-bromophenyl acetate.
