ENTRY       EC 3.6.3.37                 Enzyme
NAME        guanine-transporting ATPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances
SYSNAME     ATP phosphohydrolase (guanine-importing)
REACTION    ATP + H2O + guanineout = ADP + phosphate + guaninein [RN:R00086]
ALL_REAC    R00086
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            guanine [CPD:C00242]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            guanine [CPD:C00242]
COMMENT     ABC-type (ATP-binding cassette-type) ATPase, characterized by the presence of two similar ATP-binding domains. Does not undergo phosphorylation during the transport process. A eukaryotic enzyme that imports guanine and tryptophan (it contains a single ATP-binding site).
