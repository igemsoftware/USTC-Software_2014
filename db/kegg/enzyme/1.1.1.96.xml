NAME        diiodophenylpyruvate reductase;
            aromatic alpha-keto acid;
            KAR;
            2-oxo acid reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate + NAD+ = 3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate + NADH + H+ [RN:R03431]
ALL_REAC    R03431
SUBSTRATE   3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate [CPD:C04367];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate [CPD:C01244];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Substrates contain an aromatic ring with a pyruvate side chain. The most active substrates are halogenated derivatives. Compounds with hydroxy or amino groups in the 3 or 5 position are inactive.
