NAME        dipeptidyl-dipeptidase;
            dipeptidyl tetrapeptide hydrolase;
            dipeptidyl ligase;
            tetrapeptide dipeptidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Dipeptidyl-peptidases and tripeptidyl-peptidases
REACTION    Preferential release of dipeptides from a tetrapeptide, e.g. Ala-Gly!Ala-Gly. Acts more slowly on Ala-Ala!Ala-Ala and Gly-Gly!Gly-Gly
COMMENT     A thiol-activated peptidase from cabbage (Brassica oleracea). Tetrapeptides are formed from Ala-Ala, Gly-Gly, Ala-Gly and Gly-Ala
