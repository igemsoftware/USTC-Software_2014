SYSNAME     O-acetyl-L-serine:hydroxyurea 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase
REACTION    O-acetyl-L-serine + hydroxyurea = O-ureido-L-serine + acetate [RN:R10461]
ALL_REAC    R10461
SUBSTRATE   O-acetyl-L-serine [CPD:C00979];
            hydroxyurea [CPD:C07044]
PRODUCT     O-ureido-L-serine [CPD:C20639];
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     The enzyme participates in the biosynthetic pathway of D-cycloserine, an antibiotic substance produced by several Streptomyces species. Also catalyses EC 2.5.1.47, cysteine synthase.
