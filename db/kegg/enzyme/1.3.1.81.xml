ENTRY       EC 1.3.1.81                 Enzyme
NAME        (+)-pulegone reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (-)-menthone:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (1) (-)-menthone + NADP+ = (+)-pulegone + NADPH + H+ [RN:R06419];
            (2) (+)-isomenthone + NADP+ = (+)-pulegone + NADPH + H+ [RN:R06420]
ALL_REAC    R06419 R06420
SUBSTRATE   (-)-menthone [CPD:C00843];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            (+)-isomenthone [CPD:C11952]
PRODUCT     (+)-pulegone [CPD:C09893];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     NADH cannot replace NADPH as reductant. The Delta8,9-double bond of (+)-cis-isopulegone and the Delta1,2-double bond of (+-)-piperitone are not substrates. The enzyme from peppermint (Mentha x piperita) converts (+)-pulegone into both (-)-menthone and (+)-isomenthone at a ratio of 70:30 for native enzyme but it does not catalyse the reverse reaction. This enzyme is a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.
