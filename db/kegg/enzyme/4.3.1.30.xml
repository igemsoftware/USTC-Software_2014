COMMENT     The enzyme, which is a member of the 'AdoMet radical' (radical SAM) family, is involved in biosynthesis of TDP-alpha-D-desosamine. The reaction starts by the transfer of an electron from the reduced form of the enzyme's [4Fe-4S] cluster to S-adenosyl-L-methionine, spliting it into methionine and the radical 5-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl, which attacks the sugar substrate.
