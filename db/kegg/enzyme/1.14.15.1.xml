CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With reduced iron-sulfur protein as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (+)-camphor,reduced putidaredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxylating)
REACTION    (+)-camphor + reduced putidaredoxin + O2 = (+)-exo-5-hydroxycamphor + oxidized putidaredoxin + H2O [RN:R03818]
ALL_REAC    R03818
SUBSTRATE   (+)-camphor [CPD:C00808];
            reduced putidaredoxin;
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (+)-exo-5-hydroxycamphor [CPD:C03448];
