ENTRY       EC 3.4.21.86                Enzyme
NAME        limulus clotting enzyme;
            clotting enzyme
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Selective cleavage of -Arg18! and -Arg47! bonds in coagulogen to form coagulin and fragments
