ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.102              Enzyme
NAME        psoralen synthase;
            CYP71AJ1
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (+)-marmesin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    (+)-marmesin + NADPH + H+ + O2 = psoralen + NADP+ + acetone + 2 H2O [RN:R08207]
ALL_REAC    R08207
SUBSTRATE   (+)-marmesin [CPD:C09276];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     psoralen [CPD:C09305];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            acetone [CPD:C00207];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     This microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme is specific for (+)-marmesin, and to a much lesser extent 5-hydroxymarmesin, as substrate. Furanocoumarins protect plants from fungal invasion and herbivore attack. (+)-Columbianetin, the angular furanocoumarin analogue of the linear furanocoumarin (+)-marmesin, is not a substrate for the enzyme but it is a competitive inhibitor.
