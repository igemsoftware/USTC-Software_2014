ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.147              Enzyme
NAME        taxoid 7beta-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     taxusin,NADPH:oxygen 7-oxidoreductase
REACTION    taxusin + O2 + NADPH + H+ = 7beta-hydroxytaxusin + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R09868]
ALL_REAC    R09868
SUBSTRATE   taxusin [CPD:C20152];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     7beta-hydroxytaxusin [CPD:C20153];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Requires cytochrome P450. From the yew tree Taxus cuspidata. Does not act on earlier intermediates in taxol biosynthesis.
