NAME        mycodextranase;
            1,3-1,4-alpha-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     (1->3)-(1->4)-alpha-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase
REACTION    Endohydrolysis of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in alpha-D-glucans containing both (1->3)- and (1->4)-bonds
COMMENT     Products are nigerose and 4-alpha-D-nigerosylglucose. No hydrolysis of alpha-D-glucans containing only 1,3- or 1,4-bonds.
