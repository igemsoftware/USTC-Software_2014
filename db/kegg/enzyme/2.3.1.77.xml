NAME        triacylglycerol---sterol O-acyltransferase;
            triacylglycerol:sterol acyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     triacylglycerol:3beta-hydroxysteroid O-acyltransferase
REACTION    triacylglycerol + a 3beta-hydroxysteroid = diacylglycerol + a 3beta-hydroxysteroid ester [RN:R04055]
ALL_REAC    R04055
SUBSTRATE   triacylglycerol [CPD:C00422];
            3beta-hydroxysteroid [CPD:C02945]
PRODUCT     diacylglycerol [CPD:C00165];
            3beta-hydroxysteroid ester
COMMENT     Tripalmitoylglycerol and, more slowly, other triacylglycerols containing C6 to C22 fatty acids, can act as donors. The best acceptors are 3beta-hydroxysteroids with a planar ring system.
