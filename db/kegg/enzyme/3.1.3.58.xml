NAME        sugar-terminal-phosphatase;
            xylitol-5-phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     sugar-omega-phosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    D-glucose 6-phosphate + H2O = D-glucose + phosphate [RN:R00303]
ALL_REAC    R00303
SUBSTRATE   D-glucose 6-phosphate [CPD:C00092];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     D-glucose [CPD:C00031];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Acts on sugars and polyols phosphorylated on the terminal carbon, with a preference for sugars with a D-erythro-configuration, e.g. good substrates are glucose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, erythrose 4-phosphate and xylitol 5-phosphate.
