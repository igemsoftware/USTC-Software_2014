SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5-hydroxyfurocoumarin 5-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + a 5-hydroxyfurocoumarin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + a 5-methoxyfurocoumarin (general reaction);
            (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + bergaptol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + bergapten [RN:R02882]
ALL_REAC    R02882;
            (other) R08538
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            5-hydroxyfurocoumarin;
            bergaptol [CPD:C00758]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            5-methoxyfurocoumarin;
            bergapten [CPD:C01557]
COMMENT     Converts bergaptol into bergapten, which has therapeutic potential in the treatment of psoriasis as it has photosensitizing and antiproliferative activities [4]. The enzyme methylates the 5-hydroxy group of some hydroxy- and methylcoumarins, such as 5-hydroxyxanthotoxin [3], but has little activity on non-coumarin phenols [1]. Caffeate, 5-hydroxyferulate and daphnetin are not substrates [4]. Cu2+, Zn2+ and Co2+ cause enzyme inhibition [4]. (see also EC 2.1.1.70, 8-hydroxyfuranocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase)
