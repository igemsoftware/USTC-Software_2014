NAME        7-methylxanthosine synthase;
            xanthosine methyltransferase;
            XMT;
            xanthosine:S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyltransferase;
            CtCS1;
            CmXRS1;
            CaXMT1;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine:xanthosine 7-N-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:xanthosine N7-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + xanthosine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 7-methylxanthosine [RN:R07917]
ALL_REAC    R07917
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            xanthosine [CPD:C01762]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            7-methylxanthosine [CPD:C16352]
COMMENT     The enzyme is specific for xanthosine, as XMP and xanthine cannot act as substrates [2,4]. The enzyme does not have N1- or N3- methylation activity [2]. This is the first methylation step in the production of caffeine.
