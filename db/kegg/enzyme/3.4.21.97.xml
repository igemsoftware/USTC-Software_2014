ENTRY       EC 3.4.21.97                Enzyme
NAME        assemblin
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Cleaves -Ala!Ser- and -Ala!Ala- bonds in the scaffold protein
COMMENT     Involved in the breakdown of the scaffold protein during the late stages of assembly of the herpes-virus virion. Inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Type example of peptidase family S21. Catalytic residues are His, Ser, His, a combination not known for any other peptidase, and the protein fold also is unique. Known from herpes viruses of several types, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 3
