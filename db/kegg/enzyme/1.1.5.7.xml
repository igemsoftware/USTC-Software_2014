ENTRY       EC 1.1.5.7                  Enzyme
NAME        cyclic alcohol dehydrogenase (quinone);
            cyclic alcohol dehydrogenase;
            MCAD
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With a quinone or similar compound as acceptor
SYSNAME     cyclic alcohol:quinone oxidoreductase
REACTION    a cyclic alcohol + a quinone = a cyclic ketone + a quinol [RN:R09742]
ALL_REAC    R09742
SUBSTRATE   cyclic alcohol [CPD:C03491];
            quinone [CPD:C15602]
PRODUCT     cyclic ketone [CPD:C19862];
            quinol [CPD:C15603]
COMMENT     This enzyme oxidizes a wide variety of cyclic alcohols. Some minor enzyme activity is found with aliphatic secondary alcohols and sugar alcohols, but not primary alcohols. The enzyme is unable to catalyse the reverse reaction of cyclic ketones or aldehydes to cyclic alcohols. This enzyme differs from EC 1.1.5.5, alcohol dehydrogenase (quinone), which shows activity with ethanol [1].
