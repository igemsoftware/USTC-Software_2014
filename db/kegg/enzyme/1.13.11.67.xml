ENTRY       EC 1.13.11.67               Enzyme
NAME        8'-apo-beta-carotenoid 14',13'-cleaving dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     8'-apo-beta-carotenol:O2 oxidoreductase (14',13'-cleaving)
REACTION    8'-apo-beta-carotenol + O2 = 14'-apo-beta-carotenal + an uncharacterized product
ALL_REAC    (other) R08889
SUBSTRATE   8'-apo-beta-carotenol [CPD:C06733];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     14'-apo-beta-carotenal [CPD:C06734];
            uncharacterized product
COMMENT     A thiol-dependent enzyme isolated from rat and rabbit. Unlike EC 1.14.99.36, beta-carotene-15,15'-monooxygenase, it is not active towards beta-carotene. The secondary product has not been characterized, but may be (3E,5E)-7-hydroxy-6-methylhepta-3,5-dien-2-one.
HISTORY     EC 1.13.11.67 created 2000 as EC 1.13.12.12, transferred 2012 to EC 1.13.11.67
