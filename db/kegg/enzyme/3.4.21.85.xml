NAME        limulus clotting factor _overbar_B_
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Selective cleavage of -Arg98!Ile- bond in limulus proclotting enzyme to form active clotting enzyme
COMMENT     From the hemocyte granules of the horseshoe crabs Limulus and Tachypleus. Factor B is activated by limulus clotting factor _overbar_C_. In peptidase family S1 (trypsin family)
