ENTRY       EC 3.4.24.44                Enzyme
NAME        atrolysin E;
            Crotalus atrox metalloendopeptidase e;
            hemorrhagic toxin e
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Metalloendopeptidases
REACTION    Cleavage of Asn3!Gln, Ser9!His and Ala14!Leu bonds in insulin B chain and Tyr14!Gln and Thr8!Ser in A chain. Cleaves type IV collagen at Ala73!Gln in alpha1(IV) and at Gly7!Leu in alpha2(IV)
COMMENT     A 25.7 kDa hemorrhagic endopeptidase from the venom of the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) that digests basement membrane components, including the triple helix of type IV collagen. Such action is believed to contribute to the hemorrhagic property by weakening capillary walls. In peptidase family M12 (astacin family)
