ENTRY       EC 2.8.3.19                 Enzyme
NAME        CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase;
            acetyl-coenzyme A transferase;
            acetyl-CoA oxalate CoA-transferase;
            ACOCT;
            YfdE;
            UctC
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            CoA-transferases
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + oxalate = acetate + oxalyl-CoA [RN:R10614]
ALL_REAC    R10614
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            oxalate [CPD:C00209]
PRODUCT     acetate [CPD:C00033];
            oxalyl-CoA [CPD:C00313]
COMMENT     The enzymes characterized from the bacteria Escherichia coli and Acetobacter aceti can also use formyl-CoA and oxalate (EC 2.8.3.16, formyl-CoA transferase) or formyl-CoA and acetate, with significantly reduced specific activities.
