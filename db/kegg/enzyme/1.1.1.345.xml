NAME        D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (NAD+)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-2-hydroxycarboxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    an (R)-2-hydroxycarboxylate + NAD+ = a 2-oxocarboxylate + NADH + H+ [RN:R10222]

SUBSTRATE   (R)-2-hydroxycarboxylate [CPD:C02489];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     2-oxocarboxylate [CPD:C00161];

COMMENT     This enzyme, characterized from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei, catalyses a reversible stereospecific reduction of 2-ketocarboxylic acids into the corresponding D-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The enzyme is strictly NAD-dependent and prefers substrates with a main chain of 3-4 carbons (pyruvate and 2-oxobutanoate). Activity with 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate is 10-fold lower. cf. EC 1.1.1.272, (D)-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (NADP+).
