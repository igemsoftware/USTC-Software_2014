NAME        2-methylfumaryl-CoA isomerase;
            mesaconyl-CoA C1-C4 CoA transferase;
            Mct
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Intramolecular transferases;
            Transferring acyl groups
SYSNAME     2-methylfumaryl-CoA 1,4-CoA-mutase
REACTION    2-methylfumaryl-CoA = 3-methylfumaryl-CoA
SUBSTRATE   2-methylfumaryl-CoA [CPD:C06028]
PRODUCT     3-methylfumaryl-CoA
COMMENT     The enzyme, purified from the bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, acts as an intramolecular CoA transferase and does not transfer CoA to free mesaconate. It is part of the 3-hydroxypropanoate cycle for carbon assimilation.
