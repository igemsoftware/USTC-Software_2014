SYSNAME     3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol sulfotransferase
REACTION    3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol = adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 24-sulfate [RN:R07797]
ALL_REAC    R07797
SUBSTRATE   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate [CPD:C00053];
            5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol [CPD:C16258]
PRODUCT     adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate [CPD:C00054];
            5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 24-sulfate [CPD:C16259]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the lamprey Petromyzon marinus can also use the corresponding 3-ketone as a substrate. It is stereoselective (5alpha-cholane) and regioselective, exhibiting a preference for an hydroxy group at C-24. The enzyme is inactive when allocholic acid, which has a carboxy group at C-24, is used as a substrate.
