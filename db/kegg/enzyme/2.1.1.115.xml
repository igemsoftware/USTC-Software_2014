SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline N-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methyl-(RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline [RN:R04713]

SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline [CPD:C05201]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            N-methyl-(RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline [CPD:C05314]
COMMENT     Broad substrate specificity for (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines; including coclaurine, norcoclaurine, isococlaurine, norarmepavine, norreticuline and tetrahydropapaverine. Both R- and S-enantiomers are methylated. The enzyme participates in the pathway leading to benzylisoquinoline alkaloid synthesis in plants. The physiological substrate is likely to be coclaurine. The enzyme was earlier termed norreticuline N-methyltransferase. However, norreticuline has not been found to occur in nature and that name does not reflect the broad specificity of the enzyme for (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.
