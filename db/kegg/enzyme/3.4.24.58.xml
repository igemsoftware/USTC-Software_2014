NAME        russellysin;
            Russell's viper venom factor X activator, RVV-X;
            blood-coagulation factor X activating enzyme;
            metalloproteinase RVV-x;
            Vipera russelli proteinase;
            Russell's viper blood coagulation factor X activator;
            RVV-V
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Metalloendopeptidases
REACTION    Specifically activates several components of the blood clotting system, including coagulation factor X, coagulation factor IX and protein C by cleavage of -Arg! bonds. Has no action on insulin B chain
COMMENT     This enzyme from the venom of Russell's viper (Vipera russelli) of 79 kDa comprises a heavy (59 kDa) and a heterogeneous light (18-21 kDa) chain. Contains Ca2+ and Zn2+. The heavy chain contains the zinc-binding endopeptidase domain and a disintegrin. In peptidase family M12 (astacin family)
