SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone [RN:R07722]

SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            2,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone [CPD:C16190]
COMMENT     Specifically methylates 2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone on the 4'-position. No activity with isoflavones [2]. The enzyme is involved in formononetin biosynthesis in legumes [1]. The protein from pea (Pisum sativum) also methylates (+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain at the 3-position (cf. EC 2.1.1.270, (+)-6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase) [4].
