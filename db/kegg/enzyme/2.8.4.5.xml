SYSNAME     tRNA (N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenosine37):sulfur-(sulfur carrier),S-adenosyl-L-methionine C2-methylthiotransferase
REACTION    N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA + sulfur-(sulfur carrier) + 2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine = 2-methylthio-N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (sulfur carrier) + L-methionine + 5'-deoxyadenosine (overall reaction) [RN:R10649];

            (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-thio-N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-methylthio-N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA [RN:R10651]

PRODUCT     2-methylthio-N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA;
            S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            (sulfur carrier);
            L-methionine [CPD:C00073];
            5'-deoxyadenosine [CPD:C05198];
            2-thio-N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine37 in tRNA;
            5-deoxyadenosine
COMMENT     The enzyme, which is a member of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent radical (radical AdoMet) enzymes superfamily, binds two [4Fe-4S] clusters as well as the transferred sulfur. The sulfur donor is believed to be one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters, which is sacrificed in the process, so that in vitro the reaction is a single turnover.
