COMMENT     The peroxisomal protein sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) combines this thiolase activity with its carrier function, and is involved in branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. It also acts on 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA as a substrate but differs from EC 2.3.1.16 (acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase), which has little activity towards the 3-oxoacyl-CoA esters of 2-methyl-branched chain fatty acids such as 3-oxopristanoyl-CoA.
