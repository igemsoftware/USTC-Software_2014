REACTION    dTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucose + 2-oxoglutarate = dTDP-3-dehydro-4,6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose + L-glutamate
SUBSTRATE   dTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucose [CPD:C11910];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026]
PRODUCT     dTDP-3-dehydro-4,6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose;
            L-glutamate [CPD:C00025]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-alpha-D-desosamine, a sugar found in several bacterial macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin, megalomicin A, mycinamicin II, and oleandomycin. The reaction occurs in the reverse direction.
