ENTRY       EC 1.5.1.40                 Enzyme
NAME        8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin:NADPH oxidoreductase;
            8-OH-5dFl:NADPH oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     reduced coenzyme F420:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    reduced coenzyme F420 + NADP+ = oxidized coenzyme F420 + NADPH + H+ [RN:R09749]
ALL_REAC    R09749
SUBSTRATE   reduced coenzyme F420 [CPD:C01080];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     oxidized coenzyme F420 [CPD:C00876];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme has an absolute requirement for both the 5-deazaflavin structure and the presence of an 8-hydroxy group in the substrate [1].
