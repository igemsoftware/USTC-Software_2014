NAME        6-oxocamphor hydrolase;
            OCH;
            camK (gene name)
CLASS       Hydrolases;

            In ketonic substances
SYSNAME     bornane-2,6-dione hydrolase
REACTION    bornane-2,6-dione + H2O = [(1S)-4-hydroxy-2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl]acetate [RN:R10051]
ALL_REAC    R10051
SUBSTRATE   bornane-2,6-dione [CPD:C20320];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     [(1S)-4-hydroxy-2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl]acetate [CPD:C20324]
COMMENT     Isolated from Rhodococcus sp. The bornane ring system is cleaved by a retro-Claisen reaction to give the enol of alpha-campholonate. When separate from the enzyme the enol is tautomerised to the keto form as a 6:1 mixture of [(1S,3R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-4-oxocyclopentyl]acetate and [(1S,3S)-2,2,3-trimethyl-4-oxocyclopentyl]acetate.
