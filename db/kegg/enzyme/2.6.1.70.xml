ENTRY       EC 2.6.1.70                 Enzyme
NAME        aspartate---phenylpyruvate transaminase;
            aspartate-phenylpyruvate aminotransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring nitrogenous groups;
            Transaminases
SYSNAME     L-aspartate:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase
REACTION    L-aspartate + phenylpyruvate = oxaloacetate + L-phenylalanine [RN:R00695]
ALL_REAC    R00695
SUBSTRATE   L-aspartate [CPD:C00049];
            phenylpyruvate [CPD:C00166]
PRODUCT     oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036];
            L-phenylalanine [CPD:C00079]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Pseudomonas putida also acts on 4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate and, more slowly, on L-glutamate and L-histidine.
