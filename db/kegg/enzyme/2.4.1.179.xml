            beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-R [CPD:C04247]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-R [CPD:C04775]
COMMENT     R may be an oligosaccharide or a glycolipid; lactose can also act as acceptor, but more slowly. Involved in the elongation of oligosaccharide chains, especially in glycolipids.
