SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:ADP/ATP dimethylallyltransferase
REACTION    (1) dimethylallyl diphosphate + ADP = diphosphate + N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-diphosphate [RN:R08052];
            (2) dimethylallyl diphosphate + ATP = diphosphate + N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate [RN:R08051]

SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            ADP [CPD:C00008];
            ATP [CPD:C00002]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-diphosphate [CPD:C16426];
            N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate [CPD:C16424]
COMMENT     Involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinins in plants. The IPT4 isoform from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is specific for ADP and ATP [1]. Other isoforms, such as IPT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana [1,2] and the enzyme from the common hop, Humulus lupulus [3], also have a lower activity with AMP (cf. EC 2.5.1.27, adenylate dimethylallyltransferase).
