ENTRY       EC 4.1.2.49                 Enzyme
NAME        L-allo-threonine aldolase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Aldehyde-lyases
SYSNAME     L-allo-threonine acetaldehyde-lyase (glycine-forming)
REACTION    L-allo-threonine = glycine + acetaldehyde [RN:R06171]
ALL_REAC    R06171
SUBSTRATE   L-allo-threonine [CPD:C05519]
PRODUCT     glycine [CPD:C00037];
            acetaldehyde [CPD:C00084]
COMMENT     Requires pyridoxal phosphate. This enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Aeromonas jandaei, is specific for L-allo-threonine and can not act on either L-threonine or L-serine. Different from EC 4.1.2.5, L-threonine aldolase, and EC 4.1.2.48, low-specificity L-threonine aldolase. A previously listed enzyme with this name, EC 4.1.2.6, was deleted in 1971 after it was found to be identical to EC 2.1.2.1, glycine hydroxymethyltransferase.
