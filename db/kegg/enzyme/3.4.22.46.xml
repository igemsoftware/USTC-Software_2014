ENTRY       EC 3.4.22.46                Enzyme
NAME        L-peptidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Cysteine endopeptidases
REACTION    Autocatalytically cleaves itself from the polyprotein of the foot-and-mouth disease virus by hydrolysis of a Lys!Gly bond, but then cleaves host cell initiation factor eIF-4G at bonds -Gly!Arg- and -Lys!Arg-
COMMENT     Best known from foot-and-mouth disease virus, but occurs in other aphthoviruses and cardioviruses. Destruction of initiation factor eIF-4G has the effect of shutting off host-cell protein synthesis while allowing synthesis of viral proteins to continue. The tertiary structure reveals a distant relationship to papain and, consistent with this, compound E-64 is inhibitory. Type example of peptidase family C28.
