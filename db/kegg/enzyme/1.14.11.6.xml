ENTRY       EC 1.14.11.6                Enzyme
NAME        thymine dioxygenase;
            thymine 7-hydroxylase;
            5-hydroxy-methyluracil dioxygenase;
            5-hydroxymethyluracil oxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor
SYSNAME     thymine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating)
REACTION    thymine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = 5-hydroxymethyluracil + succinate + CO2 [RN:R01412]
ALL_REAC    R01412;
            (other) R08610 R08611
SUBSTRATE   thymine [CPD:C00178];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     5-hydroxymethyluracil [CPD:C03088];
            succinate [CPD:C00042];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     Requires Fe2+ and ascorbate. Also acts on 5-hydroxymethyluracil to oxidize its -CH2OH group first to -CHO and then to -COOH.
