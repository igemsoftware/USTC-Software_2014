ENTRY       EC 4.2.2.25                 Enzyme
NAME        gellan lyase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on polysaccharides
SYSNAME     gellan beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-D-glucopyranosyluronate lyase
REACTION    Eliminative cleavage of beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronate bonds of gellan backbone releasing tetrasaccharides containing a 4-deoxy-4,5-unsaturated D-glucopyranosyluronic acid at the non-reducing end. The tetrasaccharide produced from deacetylated gellan is beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp.
COMMENT     The enzyme is highly specific to gellan, especially deacetylated gellan.
