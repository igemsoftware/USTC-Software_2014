ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.26                 Enzyme
NAME        R-linalool synthase;
            (3R)-linalool synthase;
            (-)-3R-linalool synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(3R)-linalool-forming]
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate + H2O = (3R)-linalool + diphosphate [RN:R07632]
ALL_REAC    R07632
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     (3R)-linalool [CPD:C11388];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Geranyl diphosphate cannot be replaced by isopentenyl diphosphate, dimethylallyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate as substrate [1]. Requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. Unlike many other monoterpene synthases, only a single product, (3R)-linalool, is formed.
