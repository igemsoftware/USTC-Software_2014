ENTRY       EC 3.6.5.4                  Enzyme
NAME        signal-recognition-particle GTPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on GTP to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement
SYSNAME     GTP phosphohydrolase (protein-synthesis-assisting)
REACTION    GTP + H2O = GDP + phosphate [RN:R00335]
ALL_REAC    R00335
SUBSTRATE   GTP [CPD:C00044];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     GDP [CPD:C00035];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Activity is associated with the signal-recognition particle (a protein- and RNA-containing structure involved in endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein synthesis).
