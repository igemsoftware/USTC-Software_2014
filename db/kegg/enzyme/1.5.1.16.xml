ENTRY       EC 1.5.1.16                 Enzyme
NAME        D-lysopine dehydrogenase;
            D-lysopine synthase;
            lysopine dehydrogenase;
            D(+)-lysopine dehydrogenase;
            2-N-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (L-lysine-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (L-lysine-forming)
REACTION    N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine + NADP+ + H2O = L-lysine + pyruvate + NADPH + H+ [RN:R00452]
ALL_REAC    R00452
SUBSTRATE   N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine [CPD:C04020];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     L-lysine [CPD:C00047];
            pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     In the reverse reaction, a number of L-amino acids can act instead of L-lysine, and 2-oxobutanoate and, to a lesser extent, glyoxylate can act instead of pyruvate.
