ENTRY       EC 2.7.2.14                 Enzyme
NAME        branched-chain-fatty-acid kinase;
            isobutyrate kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a carboxy group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:branched-chain-fatty-acid 1-phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + 2-methylpropanoate = ADP + 2-methylpropanoyl phosphate [RN:R04002]
ALL_REAC    R04002
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            2-methylpropanoate [CPD:C02632]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            2-methylpropanoyl phosphate [CPD:C03754]
COMMENT     3-Methylbutanoate, 2-methylbutanoate, pentanoate, butanoate and propanoate can also act as acceptors (cf. EC 2.7.2.7 butyrate kinase).
