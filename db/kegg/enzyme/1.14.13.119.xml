ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.119              Enzyme
NAME        5-epiaristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase;
            5-epi-aristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase;
            EAH
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     5-epiaristolochene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (1- and 3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    5-epiaristolochene + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 2 O2 = capsidiol + 2 NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R09573]
ALL_REAC    R09573
SUBSTRATE   5-epiaristolochene [CPD:C19708];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     capsidiol [CPD:C09627];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). Kinetic studies suggest that 1beta-hydroxyepiaristolochene is mainly formed first followed by hydroxylation at C-3. However the reverse order via 3alpha-hydroxyepiaristolochene does occur.
