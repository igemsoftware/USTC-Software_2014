NAME        anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside 6''-O-acyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:anthocyanin-3-O-glucoside 6''-O-acyltransferase
REACTION    4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA + an anthocyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside = CoA + an anthocyanidin 3-O-[6-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucoside] [RN:R10237]

SUBSTRATE   4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA [CPD:C00223];
            anthocyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside [CPD:C15539]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            anthocyanidin 3-O-[6-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucoside] [CPD:C20461]
COMMENT     Isolated from the plants Perilla frutescens and Gentiana triflora (clustered gentian). Acts on a range of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, 3,5-di-O-glucosides and cyanidin 3-rutinoside. It did not act on delphinidin 3,3',7-tri-O-glucoside. Recombinant Perilla frutescens enzyme could utilize caffeoyl-CoA but not malonyl-CoA as alternative acyl donor.
