NAME        fatty-acyl-CoA-transporting ATPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances
SYSNAME     ATP phosphohydrolase (fatty-acyl-CoA-transporting)
REACTION    ATP + H2O + fatty acyl CoAcis = ADP + phosphate + fatty acyl CoAtrans [RN:R00086]
ALL_REAC    R00086
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            fatty acyl CoAcis
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            fatty acyl CoAtrans
COMMENT     ABC-type (ATP-binding cassette-type) ATPase, characterized by the presence of two similar ATP-binding domains. Does not undergo phosphorylation during the transport process. An animal and yeast enzyme that transports fatty acyl CoA into and out of peroxisomes. In humans, it is associated with Zellweger's syndrome.
