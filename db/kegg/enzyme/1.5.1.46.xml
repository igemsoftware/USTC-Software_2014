ENTRY       EC 1.5.1.46                 Enzyme
NAME        agroclavine dehydrogenase;
            easG (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     agroclavine:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    agroclavine + NADP+ = 6,8-dimethyl-6,7,8,9-tetradehydroergoline + NADPH + H+ [RN:R10229]
ALL_REAC    R10229
SUBSTRATE   agroclavine [CPD:C09023];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     6,8-dimethyl-6,7,8,9-tetradehydroergoline [CPD:C20457];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of ergotamine, an ergot alkaloid produced by some fungi of the Clavicipitaceae family. The reaction is catalysed in the opposite direction to that shown. The substrate for the enzyme is an iminium intermediate that is formed spontaneously from chanoclavine-I aldehyde in the presence of glutathione.
