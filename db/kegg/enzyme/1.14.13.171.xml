NAME        neopentalenolactone D synthase;
            ptlE (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (neopentalenolactone-D forming)
REACTION    1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADPH + H+ + O2 = neopentalenolactone D + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R10155]
ALL_REAC    R10155
