SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:demethylmacrocin 2'''-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + demethylmacrocin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + macrocin [RN:R02859]
ALL_REAC    R02859
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            demethylmacrocin [CPD:C02400]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            macrocin [CPD:C00744]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+. The enzyme, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces fradiae, is involved in the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic tylosin. The 2-hydroxy group of a 6-deoxy-D-allose moiety in demethylmacrocin acts as the methyl acceptor. Also acts on demethyllactenocin, giving lactenocin. Not identical with EC 2.1.1.101 macrocin O-methyltransferase.
