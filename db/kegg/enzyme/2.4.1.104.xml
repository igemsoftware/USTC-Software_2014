            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     UDP-glucose:7,8-dihydroxycoumarin 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    UDP-glucose + 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin = UDP + daphnin [RN:R03548]
ALL_REAC    R03548
SUBSTRATE   UDP-glucose [CPD:C00029];
            7,8-dihydroxycoumarin [CPD:C03093]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            daphnin [CPD:C01421]
COMMENT     Converts the aglycone daphetin into daphnin and, more slowly, esculetin into cichoriin, umbelliferone into skimmin, hydrangetin into hydrangin and scopoletin into scopolin.
