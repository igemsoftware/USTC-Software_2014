COMMENT     The enzyme from Euglena gracilis methylates Arg-38 of horse heart cytochrome c to form the Nomega-monomethyl-arginine derivative. This enzyme was previously listed together with EC 2.1.1.25 phenol O-methyltransferase and EC 2.1.1.26 iodophenol O-methyltransferase as a single, now deleted, entry (EC 2.1.1.23, protein-arginine N-methyltransferase).
HISTORY     EC 2.1.1.124 created 1999 (EC 2.1.1.23 created 1972, modified 1976, modified 1983, part incorporated 1999)
