ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.152                Enzyme
NAME        mannosylglycoprotein endo-beta-mannosidase;
            endo-beta-mannosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
REACTION    Hydrolysis of the alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl sequence of glycoprotein to alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)-D-mannose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl sequences
COMMENT     The substrate group is a substituent on N-4 of an asparagine residue in the glycoprotein. The mannose residue at the non-reducing end of the sequence may carry further alpha-D-mannosyl groups on O-3 or O-6, but such a substituent on O-3 of the beta-D-mannosyl group prevents the action of the enzyme. The enzyme was obtained from the lily, Lilium longiflorum.
