ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.51                 Enzyme
NAME        beta-phellandrene synthase (neryl-diphosphate-cyclizing);
            phellandrene synthase 1;
            PHS1;
            monoterpene synthase PHS1
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     neryl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing; beta-phellandrene-forming]
REACTION    neryl diphosphate = beta-phellandrene + diphosphate [RN:R09687]
ALL_REAC    R09687
SUBSTRATE   neryl diphosphate [CPD:C02569]
PRODUCT     beta-phellandrene [CPD:C19818];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Solanum lycopersicum has very poor affinity with geranyl diphosphate as substrate. Catalyses the formation of the acyclic myrcene and ocimene as major products in addition to beta-phellandrene [1].
