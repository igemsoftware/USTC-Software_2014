NAME        glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (acceptor);
            GDHDes;
            nondecarboxylating glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase;
            nondecarboxylating glutaconyl-coenzyme A-forming GDH;
            glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (non-decarboxylating)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     glutaryl-CoA:acceptor 2,3-oxidoreductase (non-decarboxylating)
REACTION    glutaryl-CoA + acceptor = (E)-glutaconyl-CoA + reduced acceptor [RN:R05579]
ALL_REAC    R05579
SUBSTRATE   glutaryl-CoA [CPD:C00527];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     (E)-glutaconyl-CoA [CPD:C02411];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     The enzyme contains FAD. The anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfococcus multivorans contains two glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases: a decarboxylating enzyme (EC 1.3.8.6), and a nondecarboxylating enzyme (this entry). The two enzymes cause different structural changes around the glutaconyl carboxylate group, primarily due to the presence of either a tyrosine or a valine residue, respectively, at the active site.
