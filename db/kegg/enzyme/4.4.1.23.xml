COMMENT     Requires zinc. Acts on both enantiomers of chiral epoxyalkanes to form the corresponding (R)- and (S)-2-hydroxyalkyl-CoM adducts. The enzyme will function with some other thiols (e.g., 2-sulfanylethanol) as the nucleophile. Uses short-chain epoxyalkanes from C2 (epoxyethane) to C6 (1,2-epoxyhexane). This enzyme forms component I of a four-component enzyme system {comprising EC 4.4.1.23 (2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase; component I), EC 1.8.1.5 [2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating); component II], EC 1.1.1.268 [2-(R)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component III] and EC 1.1.1.269 [2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase; component IV]} that is involved in epoxyalkane carboxylation in Xanthobacter sp. strain Py2.
