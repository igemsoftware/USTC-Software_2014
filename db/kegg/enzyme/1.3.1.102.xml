ENTRY       EC 1.3.1.102                Enzyme
NAME        2-alkenal reductase (NADP+);
            NADPH-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase;
            NADPH:2-alkenal alpha,beta-hydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     n-alkanal:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase
REACTION    an n-alkanal + NADP+ = an alk-2-enal + NADPH + H+ [RN:R07350]
ALL_REAC    R07350
SUBSTRATE   n-alkanal [CPD:C15596];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     alk-2-enal [CPD:C15597];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Shows highest activity with 1-nitrocyclohexene but also has significant activity with 2-methylpentenal and trans-cinnamaldehyde [3]. Involved in the detoxication of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Has very low activity with NAD as reductant (cf. EC 1.3.1.74, 2-alkenal reductase [NAD(P)+]).
