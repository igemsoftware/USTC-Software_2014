NAME        agaritine gamma-glutamyltransferase;
            (gamma-L-glutamyl)-N1-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)hydrazine:(acceptor) gamma-glutamyltransferase;
            (gamma-L-glutamyl)-1-N-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)hydrazine:(acceptor) gamma-glutamyltransferase;
            (gamma-L-glutamyl)-1-N-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)hydrazine:acceptor gamma-glutamyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Aminoacyltransferases
SYSNAME     (gamma-L-glutamyl)-N1-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)hydrazine:acceptor gamma-glutamyltransferase
REACTION    agaritine + acceptor = 4-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine + gamma-L-glutamyl-acceptor [RN:R03609]
ALL_REAC    R03609
SUBSTRATE   agaritine [CPD:C01550];
            acceptor [CPD:C16722]
PRODUCT     4-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine [CPD:C03994];
            gamma-L-glutamyl-acceptor [CPD:C03649]
COMMENT     4-Hydroxyaniline, cyclohexylamine, 1-naphthylhydrazine and similar compounds can act as acceptors; the enzyme also catalyses the hydrolysis of agaritine.
