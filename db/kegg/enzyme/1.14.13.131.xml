NAME        dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase;
            dimethylsulfide monooxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     dimethyl sulfide,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    dimethyl sulfide + O2 + NADH + H+ = methanethiol + formaldehyde + NAD+ + H2O [RN:R09786]
ALL_REAC    R09786
SUBSTRATE   dimethyl sulfide [CPD:C00580];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     methanethiol [CPD:C00409];
            formaldehyde [CPD:C00067];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The enzyme has lower activity with diethyl sulfide and other short-chain alkyl methyl sulfides. Its activity is stimulated by combined addition of FMN, and, after depletion of cations, of Mg2+ and Fe2+. The enzyme from Hyphomicrobium is a two component system that includes an FMN-dependent reductase subunit and a monooxygenase subunit.
