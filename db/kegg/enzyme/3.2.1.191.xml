NAME        ginsenosidase type III
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside 3-beta-D-hydrolase
REACTION    a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with two glucosyl residues at position 3 + 2 H2O = a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with no glycosidic modification at position 3 + 2 D-glucopyranose (overall reaction);
            (1a) a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with two glucosyl residues at position 3 + H2O a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with one glucosyl residue at position 3 + D-glucopyranose;
            (1b) a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with one glucosyl residue at position 3 + H2O = a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with no glycosidic modification at position 3 + D-glucopyranose
SUBSTRATE   protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with two glucosyl residues at position 3;
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with one glucosyl residue at position 3
PRODUCT     protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with no glycosidic modification at position 3;
            D-glucopyranose [CPD:C00031]
COMMENT     Ginsenosidase type III catalyses the sequential hydrolysis of the 3-O-beta-D-(1->2)-glucopyranosyl bond followed by hydrolysis of the 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl bond of protopanaxadiol ginsenosides. When acting for example on ginsenoside Rb1 the enzyme first generates ginsenoside XVII, and subsequently ginsenoside LXXV.
