ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.85                 Enzyme
NAME        beta-glucoside kinase;
            beta-D-glucoside kinase (phosphorylating)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:cellobiose 6-phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + cellobiose = ADP + 6-phospho-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->4)-D-glucose [RN:R01441 R06176]
ALL_REAC    R01441 R06176(G)
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            cellobiose [CPD:C00185]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            6-phospho-beta-D-glucosyl-(1,4)-D-glucose [CPD:C04534]
COMMENT     Phosphorylates a number of beta-D-glucosides; GTP, CTP, ITP and UTP can also act as donors.
