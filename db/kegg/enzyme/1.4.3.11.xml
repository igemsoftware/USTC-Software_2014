ENTRY       EC 1.4.3.11                 Enzyme
NAME        L-glutamate oxidase;
            glutamate (acceptor) dehydrogenase;
            glutamate oxidase;
            glutamic acid oxidase;
            glutamic dehydrogenase (acceptor);
            L-glutamic acid oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     L-glutamate:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating)
REACTION    L-glutamate + O2 + H2O = 2-oxoglutarate + NH3 + H2O2 [RN:R00250]
ALL_REAC    R00250;
            (other) R06124
SUBSTRATE   L-glutamate [CPD:C00025];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein (FAD).The enzyme from Azotobacter previously listed under this number, which did not produce H2O2, was a crude cell-free extract that probably contained catalase.
