ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.49               Enzyme
NAME        (S)-limonene 7-monooxygenase;
            (-)-limonene 7-monooxygenase;
            (-)-limonene hydroxylase;
            (-)-limonene monooxygenase;
            (-)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (S)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating)
REACTION    (S)-limonene + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (-)-perillyl alcohol + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R02470]
ALL_REAC    R02470
SUBSTRATE   (S)-limonene;
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (-)-perillyl alcohol [CPD:C02452];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     High specificity, but NADH can act instead of NADPH, although more slowly. A heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
