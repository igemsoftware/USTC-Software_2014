ENTRY       EC 4.1.3.46                 Enzyme
NAME        (R)-citramalyl-CoA lyase;
            Ccl
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Oxo-acid-lyases
SYSNAME     (3R)-citramalyl-CoA pyruvate-lyase (acetyl-CoA-forming)
REACTION    (3R)-citramalyl-CoA = acetyl-CoA + pyruvate [RN:R10674]
ALL_REAC    R10674
SUBSTRATE   (3R)-citramalyl-CoA [CPD:C20746]
PRODUCT     acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            pyruvate [CPD:C00022]
COMMENT     Requires Mn2+ ions for activity. The enzyme, purified from the bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, has no activity with (3S)-citramalyl-CoA (cf. EC 4.1.3.25, (S)-citramalyl-CoA lyase).
