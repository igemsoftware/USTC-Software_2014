            adenylyltransferase and sulfurtransferase MOCS3

SYSNAME     ATP:molybdopterin-synthase adenylyltransferase
REACTION    ATP + [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-Gly = diphosphate + [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-Gly-AMP
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-Gly
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-Gly-AMP
COMMENT     Adenylates the C-terminus of the small subunit of the molybdopterin synthase. This activation is required to form the thiocarboxylated C-terminus of the active molybdopterin synthase small subunit. The reaction occurs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the human, the reaction is catalysed by the N-terminal domain of the protein MOCS3, which also includes a molybdopterin-synthase sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.11) C-terminal domain.
