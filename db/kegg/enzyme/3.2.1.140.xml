NAME        lacto-N-biosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     oligosaccharide lacto-N-biosylhydrolase
REACTION    beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc + H2O = beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc + beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc [RN:R05166 R06116]

SUBSTRATE   beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc [CPD:C06371];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc [CPD:C06372];
            beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc [CPD:C00243]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Streptomyces specifically hydrolyses the terminal lacto-N-biosyl residue (beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc) from the non-reducing end of oligosaccharides with the structure beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->R). Lacto-N-hexaose (beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc) is hydrolysed to form first lacto-N-tetraose plus lacto-N-biose, with the subsequent formation of lactose. Oligosaccharides in which the non-reducing terminal Gal or the penultimate GlcNAc are replaced by fucose or sialic acid are not substrates. Asialo GM1 tetraose (beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc) is hydrolysed very slowly, but lacto-N-neotetraose (beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc) is not a substrate
