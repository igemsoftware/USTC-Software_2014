NAME        GDP-L-colitose synthase;
            ColC
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     GDP-beta-L-colitose:NAD(P)+ 4-oxidoreductase (5-epimerizing)
REACTION    GDP-beta-L-colitose + NAD(P)+ = GDP-4-dehydro-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-mannose + NAD(P)H + H+ [RN:R10420 R10421]
ALL_REAC    R10420 R10421
SUBSTRATE   GDP-beta-L-colitose [CPD:C20613];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     GDP-4-dehydro-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-mannose [CPD:C20612];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of L-colitose, a 3,6-dideoxyhexose found in the O-antigen of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides, where it catalyses the reaction in the reverse direction. The enzyme also performs the NAD(P)H-dependent epimerisation at C-5 of the sugar. The enzyme from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is Si-specific with respect to NAD(P)H [1].
