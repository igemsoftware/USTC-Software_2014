            1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->4)-linkages in (1->4)-beta-D-glucans, to remove successive glucose units
