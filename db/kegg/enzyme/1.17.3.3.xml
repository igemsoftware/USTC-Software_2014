ENTRY       EC 1.17.3.3                 Enzyme
NAME        6-hydroxynicotinate dehydrogenase;
            6-hydroxynicotinic acid hydroxylase;
            6-hydroxynicotinic acid dehydrogenase;
            6-hydroxynicotinate hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on CH or CH2 groups;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     6-hydroxynicotinate:O2 oxidoreductase
REACTION    6-hydroxynicotinate + H2O + O2 = 2,6-dihydroxynicotinate + H2O2 [RN:R07221]
ALL_REAC    R07221
SUBSTRATE   6-hydroxynicotinate [CPD:C01020];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2,6-dihydroxynicotinate [CPD:C15523];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     Contains [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur centres, FAD and molybdenum. It also has a catalytically essential, labile selenium that can be removed by reaction with cyanide. In Bacillus niacini, this enzyme is required for growth on nicotinic acid.
