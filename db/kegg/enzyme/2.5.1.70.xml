NAME        naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase;
            N8DT
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + (-)-(2S)-naringenin = diphosphate + sophoraflavanone B [RN:R08951]
ALL_REAC    R08951
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            (-)-(2S)-naringenin [CPD:C00509]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            sophoraflavanone B [CPD:C18023]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+. This membrane-bound protein is located in the plastids [2]. In addition to naringenin, the enzyme can prenylate several other flavanones at the C-8 position, but more slowly. Along with EC 1.14.13.103 (8-dimethylallylnaringenin 2'-hydroxylase) and EC 2.5.1.71 (leachianone G 2''-dimethylallyltransferase), this enzyme forms part of the sophoraflavanone-G-biosynthesis pathway.
