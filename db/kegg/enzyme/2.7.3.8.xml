ENTRY       EC 2.7.3.8                  Enzyme
NAME        ammonia kinase;
            phosphoramidate-adenosine diphosphate phosphotransferase;
            phosphoramidate-ADP-phosphotransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a nitrogenous group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:ammonia phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + NH3 = ADP + phosphoramide [RN:R00141]
ALL_REAC    R00141
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphoramide [CPD:C02058]
COMMENT     Has a wide specificity. In the reverse direction, N-phosphoglycine and N-phosphohistidine can also act as phosphate donors, and ADP, dADP, GDP, CDP, dTDP, dCDP, IDP and UDP can act as phosphate acceptors (in decreasing order of activity).
