PRODUCT     1,2-diacyl-3-O-[alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-galactosyl]-sn-glycerol;
            1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol [CPD:C00641]
COMMENT     By further transfers of galactosyl residues to the digalactosyldiacylglycerol, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol and tetragalactosyldiacylglycerol are also formed. This enzyme was originally thought to be the major enzyme involved in the production of digalactosyldiacylglycerol in plants as it masked the effect of the true enzyme (EC 2.4.1.241, digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase) [4,5]. Its activity is localized to chloroplast envelope membranes, but it does not contribute to net galactolipid synthesis in plants [4].
