NAME        adenylate dimethylallyltransferase;
            cytokinin synthase (ambiguous);
            isopentenyltransferase (ambiguous);
            2-isopentenyl-diphosphate:AMP Delta2-isopentenyltransferase;
            adenylate isopentenyltransferase (ambiguous);
            IPT
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:AMP dimethylallyltransferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + AMP = diphosphate + N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-phosphate [RN:R04038]
ALL_REAC    R04038
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            AMP [CPD:C00020]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine 5'-phosphate [CPD:C04713]
COMMENT     Involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinins in plants. Some isoforms from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana are specific for AMP while others also have the activity of EC 2.5.1.112, adenylate dimethylallyltransferase (ADP/ATP-dependent).
