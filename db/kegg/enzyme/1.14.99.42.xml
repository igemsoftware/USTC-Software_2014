ENTRY       EC 1.14.99.42               Enzyme
NAME        zeaxanthin 7,8-dioxygenase;
            zeaxanthin 7,8(7',8')-cleavage dioxygenase;
            CsZCD
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            Miscellaneous
SYSNAME     zeaxanthin:oxygen oxidoreductase (7,8-cleaving)
REACTION    zeaxanthin + 2 O2 = crocetin dialdehyde + 2 (3S)-3-hydroxycyclocitral [RN:R09603]
ALL_REAC    R09603
SUBSTRATE   zeaxanthin [CPD:C06098];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     crocetin dialdehyde [CPD:C19730];
            (3S)-3-hydroxycyclocitral [CPD:C19731]
COMMENT     Presumably the enzyme acts twice on zeaxanthin cleaving 3-hydroxycyclocitral off each 3-hydroxy end group.
