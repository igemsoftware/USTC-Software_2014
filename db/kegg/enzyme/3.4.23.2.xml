ENTRY       EC 3.4.23.2                 Enzyme
NAME        pepsin B;
            parapepsin I;
            pig gelatinase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Aspartic endopeptidases
REACTION    Degradation of gelatin; little activity on hemoglobin. Specificity on B chain of insulin more restricted than that of pepsin A; does not cleave at Phe1-Val, Gln4-His or Gly23-Phe
COMMENT     Formed from pig pepsinogen B. In peptidase family A1 (pepsin A family)
HISTORY     EC 3.4.23.2 created 1961 as EC 3.4.4.2, transferred 1972 to EC 3.4.23.2, modified 1986
