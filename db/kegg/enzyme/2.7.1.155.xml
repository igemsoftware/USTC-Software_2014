ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.155      Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Transferred to 2.7.4.24
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
COMMENT     Transferred entry: diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase. Now EC 2.7.4.24, diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase. The enzyme had been incorrectly classified as the reaction involves transfer of a phospho group to another phospho group (EC 2.7.4) rather than to an hydroxy group (EC 2.7.1)
HISTORY     EC 2.7.1.155 created 2003, deleted 2007
