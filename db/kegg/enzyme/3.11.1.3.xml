ENTRY       EC 3.11.1.3                 Enzyme
NAME        phosphonopyruvate hydrolase;
            PPH
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds;
            Acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds (only sub-subclass identified to date)
REACTION    3-phosphonopyruvate + H2O = pyruvate + phosphate [RN:R08200]
ALL_REAC    R08200
SUBSTRATE   3-phosphonopyruvate [CPD:C02798];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Highly specific for phosphonopyruvate as substrate [2]. The reaction is not inhibited by phosphate but is inhibited by the phosphonates phosphonoformic acid, hydroxymethylphosphonic acid and 3-phosphonopropanoic acid [2]. The enzyme is activated by the divalent cations Co2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+. This enzyme is a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase/isocitrate lyase superfamily [3].
