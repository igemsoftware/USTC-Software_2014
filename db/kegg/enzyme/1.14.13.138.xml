CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     indolin-2-one,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    indolin-2-one + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = 3-hydroxyindolin-2-one + NAD(P)+ + H2O [RN:R07421]
