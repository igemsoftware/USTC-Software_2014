NAME        [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-lysine N-methyltransferase;
            rubisco methyltransferase;
            ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase N-methyltransferase;
            ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit epsilonN-methyltransferase;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[3-phospho-D-glycerate-carboxy-lyase (dimerizing)]-lysine 6-N-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-lysine N6-methyltransferase
REACTION    3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-L-lysine = 3 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-L-lysine
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase]-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine
COMMENT     The enzyme methylates a conserved lysine in the C-terminal part of higher plant fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13). The enzyme from pea (Pisum sativum) also methylates Lys-14 in the large subunits of hexadecameric higher plant ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) [2], but that from Arabidopsis thaliana does not.
