            PPDK regulatory protein (ambiguous);
            pyruvate;
            phosphate dikinase regulatory protein (ambiguous);
            bifunctional dikinase regulatory protein (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;

            Protein-serine/threonine kinases
SYSNAME     ADP:[pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphotransferase
REACTION    ADP + [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] = AMP + [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate
SUBSTRATE   ADP [CPD:C00008];
            [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase]
PRODUCT     AMP [CPD:C00020];
            [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate
COMMENT     The enzymes from the plants Zea mays (maize) and Arabidopsis thaliana are bifunctional and catalyse both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of EC 2.7.9.1 (pyruvate, phosphate dikinase). cf. EC 2.7.4.27, [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase]-phosphate phosphotransferase [2-5]. The enzyme is specific for a reaction intermediate form of EC 2.7.9.1, and phosphorylates a threonine located adjacent to the catalytic histidine. The phosphorylation only takes place if the histidine is already phosphorylated [3-5].
