ENTRY       EC 2.2.1.8                  Enzyme
NAME        fluorothreonine transaldolase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups;
            Transketolases and transaldolases
SYSNAME     fluoroacetaldehyde:L-threonine aldehydetransferase
REACTION    L-threonine + fluoroacetaldehyde = acetaldehyde + 4-fluoro-L-threonine [RN:R07247]
ALL_REAC    R07247
SUBSTRATE   L-threonine [CPD:C00188];
            fluoroacetaldehyde [CPD:C15488]
PRODUCT     acetaldehyde [CPD:C00084];
            4-fluoro-L-threonine [CPD:C15533]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal phosphate protein. Can also convert chloroacetaldehyde into4-chloro-L-threonine. Unlike EC 2.1.2.1, glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, does not use glycine as a substrate.
