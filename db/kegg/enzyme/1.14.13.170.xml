NAME        pentalenolactone D synthase;
            penE (gene name);
            pntE (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (pentalenolactone-D forming)
REACTION    1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADPH + H+ + O2 = pentalenolactone D + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R10154]
ALL_REAC    R10154
SUBSTRATE   1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate [CPD:C20400];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     pentalenolactone D [CPD:C20399];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A FAD-dependent oxygenase. Isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces exfoliatus and Streptomyces arenae. The ketone undergoes a biological Baeyer-Villiger reaction. Part of the pathway of pentalenolactone biosynthesis.
