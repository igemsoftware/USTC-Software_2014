NAME        acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme;
            Dke1;
            acetylacetone dioxygenase;
            diketone cleaving dioxygenase;
            diketone cleaving enzyme
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     acetylacetone:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    pentane-2,4-dione + O2 = acetate + methylglyoxal [RN:R07183]
ALL_REAC    R07183
SUBSTRATE   pentane-2,4-dione [CPD:C15499];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     acetate [CPD:C00033];
            methylglyoxal [CPD:C00546]
COMMENT     An Fe(II)-dependent enzyme. Forms the first step in the acetylacetone degradation pathway of Acinetobacter johnsonii. While acetylacetone is by far the best substrate, heptane-3,5-dione, octane-2,4-dione, 2-acetylcyclohexanone and ethyl acetoacetate can also act as substrates.
