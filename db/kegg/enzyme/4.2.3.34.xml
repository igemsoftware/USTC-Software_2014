NAME        stemod-13(17)-ene synthase;
            OsKSL11;
            stemodene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     9alpha-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [stemod-13(17)-ene-forming]
REACTION    9alpha-copalyl diphosphate = stemod-13(17)-ene + diphosphate [RN:R09116]
ALL_REAC    R09116
SUBSTRATE   9alpha-copalyl diphosphate [CPD:C11902]
PRODUCT     stemod-13(17)-ene [CPD:C18224];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     This enzyme catalyses the committed step in the biosynthesis of the stemodane family of diterpenoid secondary metabolites, some of which possess mild antiviral activity. The enzyme also produces stemod-12-ene and stemar-13-ene as minor products.
