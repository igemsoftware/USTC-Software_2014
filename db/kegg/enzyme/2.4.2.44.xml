NAME        S-methyl-5'-thioinosine phosphorylase;
            MTIP;
            MTI phosphorylase;
            methylthioinosine phosphorylase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Pentosyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-methyl-5'-thioinosine:phosphate S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribosyl-transferase
REACTION    S-methyl-5'-thioinosine + phosphate = hypoxanthine + S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate [RN:R09668]
ALL_REAC    R09668
SUBSTRATE   S-methyl-5'-thioinosine [CPD:C19787];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     hypoxanthine [CPD:C00262];
            S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate [CPD:C04188]
COMMENT     No activity with S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine. The catabolism of of 5'-methylthioadenosine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves deamination to S-methyl-5'-thioinosine (EC 3.5.4.31, S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase) and phosphorolysis to hypoxanthine [1].
