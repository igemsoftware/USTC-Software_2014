ENTRY       EC 5.4.2.5                  Enzyme
NAME        phosphoglucomutase (glucose-cofactor);
            glucose phosphomutase;
            glucose-1-phosphate phosphotransferase
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Intramolecular transferases;
            Phosphotransferases (phosphomutases)
SYSNAME     alpha-D-glucose 1,6-phosphomutase (glucose-cofactor)
REACTION    alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate = D-glucose 6-phosphate [RN:R08639]
ALL_REAC    R08639 > R00959
SUBSTRATE   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00103]
PRODUCT     D-glucose 6-phosphate [CPD:C00092]
COMMENT     The enzyme is activated by D-glucose, which probably acts as an acceptor for a phosphate residue from the substrate, thus being itself converted into the product. cf. EC 5.4.2.2, phosphoglucomutase (alpha-D-glucose-1,6-bisphosphate-dependent).
