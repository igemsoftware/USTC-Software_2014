NAME        fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester synthase;
            FAEES
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Carboxylic-ester hydrolases
SYSNAME     long-chain-fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester acylhydrolase
REACTION    a long-chain-fatty-acyl ethyl ester + H2O = a long-chain-fatty acid + ethanol [RN:R02682]
ALL_REAC    R02682
SUBSTRATE   long-chain-fatty-acyl ethyl ester [CPD:C04202];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     long-chain-fatty acid;
            ethanol [CPD:C00469]
COMMENT     In the reverse reaction, forms ethyl esters from fatty acids and ethanol in the absence of coenzyme A or ATP. Best substrates are unsaturated octadecanoic acids; palmitate, stearate and arachidonate also act, but more slowly.
