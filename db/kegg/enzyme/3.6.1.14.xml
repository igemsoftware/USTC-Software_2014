ENTRY       EC 3.6.1.14                 Enzyme
NAME        adenosine-tetraphosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            In phosphorus-containing anhydrides
SYSNAME     adenosine-tetraphosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate + H2O = ATP + phosphate [RN:R00128]
ALL_REAC    R00128;
            (other) R00723
SUBSTRATE   adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate [CPD:C03483];
