NAME        [myelin basic protein]-arginine N-methyltransferase;
            myelin basic protein methylase I;
            protein methylase I;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[myelin-basic-protein]-arginine omega-N-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[myelin-basic-protein]-arginine Nomega-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [myelin basic protein]-arginine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [myelin basic protein]-Nomega-methyl-arginine [RN:R04719]
ALL_REAC    R04719
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            [myelin basic protein]-arginine [CPD:C05207]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            [myelin basic protein]-Nomega-methyl-arginine
COMMENT     The enzyme from mammalian brain forms the Nomega-monomethyl-, Nomega,Nomega-dimethyl- and Nomega,Nomega'-dimethyl-arginine derivatives. The name protein methylase I is misleading since it has been used for a number of enzymes with different specificities.
