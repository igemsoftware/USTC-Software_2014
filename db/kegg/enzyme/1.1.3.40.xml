NAME        D-mannitol oxidase;
            mannitol oxidase;
            D-arabitol oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     mannitol:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing)
REACTION    mannitol + O2 = mannose + H2O2 [RN:R05698]
ALL_REAC    R05698
SUBSTRATE   mannitol [CPD:C00392];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     mannose [CPD:C00159];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     Also catalyses the oxidation of D-arabinitol and, to a lesser extent, D-glucitol (sorbitol), whereas L-arabinitol is not a good substrate. The enzyme from the snails Helix aspersa and Arion ater is found in a specialised tubular organelle that has been termed the mannosome.
