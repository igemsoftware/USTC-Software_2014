ENTRY       EC 1.14.12.16               Enzyme
NAME        2-hydroxyquinoline 5,6-dioxygenase;
            2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 5,6-dioxygenase;
            quinolin-2-ol 5,6-dioxygenase;
            quinolin-2(1H)-one 5,6-dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     quinolin-2-ol,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (5,6-hydroxylating)
REACTION    quinolin-2-ol + NADH + H+ + O2 = 2,5,6-trihydroxy-5,6-dihydroquinoline + NAD+ [RN:R05157]
ALL_REAC    R05157
SUBSTRATE   quinolin-2-ol [CPD:C06338];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2,5,6-trihydroxy-5,6-dihydroquinoline [CPD:C06339];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
COMMENT     3-Methylquinolin-2-ol, quinolin-8-ol and quinolin-2,8-diol are also substrates. Quinolin-2-ols exist largely as their quinolin-2(1H)-one tautomers
