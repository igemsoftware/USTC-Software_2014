ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.299                Enzyme
NAME        malate dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+];
            MdH II, NAD(P)+-dependent malate dehyrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (S)-malate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (S)-malate + NAD(P)+ = oxaloacetate + NAD(P)H + H+ [RN:R00342 R00343]
ALL_REAC    R00342 R00343
SUBSTRATE   (S)-malate [CPD:C00149];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     This enzyme, which was characterized from the methanogenic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, catalyses only the reduction of oxaloacetate, and can use NAD+ and NADP+ with similar specific activity [1]. 
            Different from EC 1.1.1.37 (malate dehydrogenase (NAD+)), EC 1.1.1.82 (malate dehydrogenase (NADP+)) and EC 1.1.5.4 (malate dehydrogenase (quinone)).
