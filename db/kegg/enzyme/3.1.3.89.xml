ENTRY       EC 3.1.3.89                 Enzyme
NAME        5'-deoxynucleotidase;
            yfbR (gene name)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate + H2O = a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside + phosphate
SUBSTRATE   2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate;
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     2'-deoxyribonucleoside;
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Escherichia coli, shows strict specificity towards deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates and does not dephosphorylate 5'-ribonucleotides or ribonucleoside 3'-monophosphates. A divalent metal cation is required for activity, with cobalt providing the highest activity.
