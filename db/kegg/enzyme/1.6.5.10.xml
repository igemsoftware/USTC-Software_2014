ENTRY       EC 1.6.5.10                 Enzyme
NAME        NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone);
            reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (quinone) dehydrogenase;
            NADPH oxidase;
            NADPH2 dehydrogenase (quinone)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on NADH or NADPH;
            With a quinone or similar compound as acceptor
SYSNAME     NADPH:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase
REACTION    NADPH + H+ + a quinone = NADP+ + a quinol [RN:R07359]
ALL_REAC    R07359
SUBSTRATE   NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            quinone [CPD:C15602]
PRODUCT     NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            quinol [CPD:C15603]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein [1, 2]. The enzyme from Escherichia coli is specific for NADPH and is most active with quinone derivatives and ferricyanide as electron acceptors [3].
            Menaquinone can act as acceptor. The enzyme from hog liver is inhibited by dicoumarol and folic acid derivatives but not by 2,4-dinitrophenol [1].
