ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.158                Enzyme
NAME        alpha-agarase;
            agarase (ambiguous);
            agaraseA33
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     agarose 3-glycanohydrolase
REACTION    Endohydrolysis of (1->3)-alpha-L-galactosidic linkages in agarose, yielding agarotetraose as the major product
COMMENT     Requires Ca2+. The enzyme from Thalassomonas sp. can use agarose, agarohexaose and neoagarohexaose as substrate. The products of agarohexaose hydrolysis are dimers and tetramers, with agarotetraose being the predominant product, whereas hydrolysis of neoagarohexaose gives rise to two types of trimer. While the enzyme can also hydrolyse the highly sulfated agarose porphyran very efficiently, it cannot hydrolyse the related compounds kappa-carrageenan (see EC 3.2.1.83) and iota-carrageenan (see EC 3.2.1.157) [2]. See also EC 3.2.1.81, beta-agarase.
