ENTRY       EC 1.3.8.3                  Enzyme
NAME        (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
            BbsG;
            (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With a flavin as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:electron transfer flavoprotein oxidoreductase
REACTION    (R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein = (E)-2-benzylidenesuccinyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein
ALL_REAC    (other) R05584
SUBSTRATE   (R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA [CPD:C09817];
            electron-transfer flavoprotein [CPD:C04253]
PRODUCT     (E)-2-benzylidenesuccinyl-CoA [CPD:C09818];
            reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein [CPD:C04570]
COMMENT     Requires FAD as prosthetic group. Unlike other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, this enzyme exhibits high substrate- and enantiomer specificity; it is highly specific for (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA and is inhibited by (S)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA. Forms the third step in the anaerobic toluene metabolic pathway in Thauera aromatica. Ferricenium ion is an effective artificial electron acceptor.
