NAME        glycerophospholipid arachidonoyl-transferase (CoA-independent)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine arachidonoyltransferase (CoA-independent)
REACTION    1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine = 1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [RN:R04720]
ALL_REAC    R04720
SUBSTRATE   1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;
            1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [CPD:C05209]
PRODUCT     1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine;
            1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [CPD:C04317]
COMMENT     Catalyses the transfer of arachidonate and other polyenoic fatty acids from intact choline or ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids to the sn-2 position of a lyso-glycerophospholipid. The organyl group on sn-1 of the donor or acceptor molecule can be alkyl, acyl or alk-1-enyl. The term 'radyl' has sometimes been used to refer to such substituting groups. Differs from EC 2.3.1.148 glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent) in not requiring CoA and in its specificity for poly-unsaturated acyl groups.
