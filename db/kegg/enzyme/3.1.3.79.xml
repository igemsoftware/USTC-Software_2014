COMMENT     This enzyme, from the soil proteobacterium and plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, requires Mg2+ for activity. Mannosylfructose is the major endogenous osmolyte produced by several alpha-proteobacteria in response to osmotic stress and is synthesized by the sequential action of EC 2.4.1.246 (mannosylfructose-phosphate synthase) followed by this enzyme. While mannosylfructose 6-phosphate is the physiological substrate, the enzyme can use sucrose 6-phosphate very efficiently. The F in mannosylfructose 6F-phosphate is used to indicate that the fructose residue of sucrose carries the substituent.
