NAME        3-hydroxybenzoate 6-monooxygenase;
            3-hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase;
            m-hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase;
            3-hydroxybenzoic acid-6-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     3-hydroxybenzoate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-hydroxylating)
REACTION    3-hydroxybenzoate + NADH + H+ + O2 = 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate + NAD+ + H2O [RN:R02589]
ALL_REAC    R02589
SUBSTRATE   3-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00587];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2,5-dihydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00628];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein (FAD). Acts also on a number of analogues of 3-hydroxybenzoate substituted in the 2, 4, 5 and 6 positions; NADPH can act instead of NADH, but more slowly.
