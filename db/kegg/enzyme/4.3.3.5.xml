NAME        4'-demethylrebeccamycin synthase;
            arcyriaflavin A N-glycosyltransferase;
            RebG
CLASS       Lyases;

SYSNAME     4'-demethylrebeccamycin D-glucose-lyase
REACTION    4'-O-demethylrebeccamycin + H2O = dichloro-arcyriaflavin A + beta-D-glucose [RN:R09568]
ALL_REAC    R09568
SUBSTRATE   4'-O-demethylrebeccamycin [CPD:C19700];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     dichloroarcyriaflavin A [CPD:C19699];
            beta-D-glucose [CPD:C00221]
COMMENT     This enzyme catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by the bacterium Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. The enzyme is a glycosylase, and acts in the reverse direction to that shown. It has a wide substrate range, and was shown to glycosylate several substrates, including the staurosporine aglycone, EJG-III-108A, J-104303, 6-N-methyl-arcyriaflavin C and indolo-[2,3-a]-carbazole [1,2].
