NAME        citrate-lyase deacetylase;
            [citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase] thiolesterase;
            acetyl-S-(acyl-carrier protein) enzyme thioester hydrolase;
            citrate lyase deacetylase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Thioester hydrolases
SYSNAME     [citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl-form) hydrolase
REACTION    [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl form) + 6 H2O = [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](thiol form) + 6 acetate [RN:R04450]
ALL_REAC    R04450
SUBSTRATE   [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl form) [CPD:C04334];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](thiol form) [CPD:C04298];
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     In the proteobacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus, this enzyme modulates the activity of EC 4.1.3.6, citrate (pro-3S)-lyase, by converting it from its active acetyl form into its inactive thiol form by removal of its acetyl groups [2]. The activity of citrate-lyase deacetylase is itself inhibited by L-glutamate [2].
