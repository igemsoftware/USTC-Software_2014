SUBSTRATE   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose [CPD:C11907]
PRODUCT     dTDP-3-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose [CPD:C19960]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose. Four moieties of alpha-D-rhamnose and two moities of 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose form the repeating unit of the glycan chain in the S-layer of the bacterium Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus.
