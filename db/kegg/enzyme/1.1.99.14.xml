NAME        glycolate dehydrogenase;
            glycolate oxidoreductase;
            glycolic acid dehydrogenase;
            glycolate:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     glycolate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase
REACTION    glycolate + acceptor = glyoxylate + reduced acceptor [RN:R00476]
ALL_REAC    R00476
SUBSTRATE   glycolate [CPD:C00160];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
