ENTRY       EC 3.5.4.30                 Enzyme
NAME        dCTP deaminase (dUMP-forming)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In cyclic amidines
SYSNAME     dCTP aminohydrolase (dUMP-forming)
REACTION    dCTP + 2 H2O = dUMP + diphosphate + NH3 [RN:R07307]
ALL_REAC    R07307
SUBSTRATE   dCTP [CPD:C00458];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     dUMP [CPD:C00365];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+. Is highly specific for dCTP as substrate as dCMP, CTP, CDP, CMP, cytosine or deoxycytosine are not deaminated. While most bacteria require two enzymes to form dUMP from dCTP (EC 3.5.4.13, dCTP deaminase and EC 3.6.1.23, dUTP diphosphatase), the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii uses a single enzyme to carry out both functions. This enzyme can also act as a dUTP diphosphatase, but more slowly.
