ENTRY       EC 1.1.99.27                Enzyme
NAME        (R)-pantolactone dehydrogenase (flavin);
            2-dehydropantolactone reductase (flavin);
            2-dehydropantoyl-lactone reductase (flavin);
            (R)-pantoyllactone dehydrogenase (flavin)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     (R)-pantolactone:acceptor oxidoreductase (flavin-containing)
REACTION    (R)-pantolactone + acceptor = 2-dehydropantolactone + reduced acceptor [RN:R03156]
ALL_REAC    R03156
SUBSTRATE   (R)-pantolactone [CPD:C01012];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     2-dehydropantolactone [CPD:C01125];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     High specificity for (R)-pantolactone. Phenazine methosulfate (PMS) can act as acceptor. The enzyme has been studied in the bacterium Nocardia asteroides and shown to be membrane-bound and induced by 1,2-propanediol. The FMN cofactor is non-covalently bound.
