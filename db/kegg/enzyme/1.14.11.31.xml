NAME        thebaine 6-O-demethylase;
            T6ODM
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor
SYSNAME     thebaine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-O-demethylating)
REACTION    thebaine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = neopinone + formaldehyde + succinate + CO2 [RN:R05126]
ALL_REAC    R05126;
            (other) R03698
SUBSTRATE   thebaine [CPD:C06173];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     neopinone [CPD:C06172];
            formaldehyde [CPD:C00067];
            succinate [CPD:C00042];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     Requires Fe2+. Catalyses a step in morphine biosynthesis. The product neopinione spontaneously rearranges to the more stable codeinone. The enzyme also catalyses the 6-O-demethylation of oripavine to morphinone, with lower efficiency.
