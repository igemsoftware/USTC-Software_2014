ENTRY       EC 1.21.99.1                Enzyme
NAME        beta-cyclopiazonate dehydrogenase;
            beta-cyclopiazonate oxidocyclase;
            beta-cyclopiazonic oxidocyclase;
            beta-cyclopiazonate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase (cyclizing)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     beta-cyclopiazonate:acceptor oxidoreductase (cyclizing)
REACTION    beta-cyclopiazonate + acceptor = alpha-cyclopiazonate + reduced acceptor [RN:R04080]
ALL_REAC    R04080
SUBSTRATE   beta-cyclopiazonate [CPD:C02899];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     alpha-cyclopiazonate [CPD:C03032];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein (FAD). Cytochrome c and various dyes can act as acceptor. Cyclopiazonate is a microbial toxin.
