ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.68                 Enzyme
NAME        isoamylase;
            debranching enzyme;
            glycogen alpha-1,6-glucanohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     glycogen 6-alpha-D-glucanohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic branch linkages in glycogen, amylopectin and their beta-limit dextrins
COMMENT     Also readily hydrolyses amylopectin. Differs from EC 3.2.1.41 (pullulanase) and EC 3.2.1.142 (limit dextrinase) by its inability to hydrolyse pullulan, and by limited action on alpha-limit dextrins. Maltose is the smallest sugar it can release from an alpha-(1->6)-linkage.
