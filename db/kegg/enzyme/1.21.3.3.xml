ENTRY       EC 1.21.3.3                 Enzyme
NAME        reticuline oxidase;
            BBE;
            berberine bridge enzyme;
            berberine-bridge-forming enzyme;
            tetrahydroprotoberberine synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     (S)-reticuline:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylene-bridge-forming)
REACTION    (S)-reticuline + O2 = (S)-scoulerine + H2O2 [RN:R03831]
ALL_REAC    R03831
SUBSTRATE   (S)-reticuline [CPD:C02105];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (S)-scoulerine [CPD:C02106];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     Contains FAD. The enzyme from the plant Eschscholtzia californica binds the cofactor covalently [3]. Acts on (S)-reticuline and related compounds, converting the N-methyl group into the methylene bridge ('berberine bridge') of (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberines. The product of the reaction, (S)-scoulerine, is a precursor of protopine, protoberberine and benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis in plants.
