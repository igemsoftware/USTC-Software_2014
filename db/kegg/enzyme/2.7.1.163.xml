ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.163                Enzyme
NAME        hygromycin B 4-O-kinase;
            hygromycin-B kinase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:hygromycin-B 4-O-phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + hygromycin B = ADP + 4-O-phosphohygromycin B [RN:R09729]
ALL_REAC    R09729
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            hygromycin B [CPD:C01925]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            4-O-phosphohygromycin B [CPD:C19850]
COMMENT     Phosphorylates the antibiotic hygromycin B. Whereas the enzyme from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (EC 2.7.1.119; hygromycin-B 7''-O-kinase) catalyses the formation of 7''-O-phosphohygromycin B, this enzyme, found in Escherichia coli carrying a plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin-B, forms 4-O-phosphohygromycin B.
