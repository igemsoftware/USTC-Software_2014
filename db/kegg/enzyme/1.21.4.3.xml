ENTRY       EC 1.21.4.3                 Enzyme
NAME        sarcosine reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond;
            With a disulfide as acceptor
SYSNAME     acetyl-phosphate methylamine:thioredoxin disulfide oxidoreductase (N-methylglycine-forming)
REACTION    acetyl phosphate + methylamine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O = N-methylglycine + phosphate + thioredoxin [RN:R07227]
ALL_REAC    R07227
SUBSTRATE   acetyl phosphate [CPD:C00227];
            methylamine [CPD:C00218];
            thioredoxin disulfide [CPD:C00343];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     N-methylglycine [CPD:C00213];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            thioredoxin [CPD:C00342]
COMMENT     The reaction is observed only in the direction of sarcosine reduction. The enzyme from Eubacterium acidaminophilum consists of subunits A, B and C. Subunit B contains selenocysteine and a pyruvoyl group, and is responsible for sarcosine binding and methylamine release. Subunit A, which also contains selenocysteine, is reduced by thioredoxin, and is needed to convert the carboxymethyl group into a ketene equivalent, in turn used by subunit C to produce acetyl phosphate. Only subunit B distinguishes this enzyme from EC 1.21.4.2 (glycine reductase) and EC 1.21.4.4 (betaine reductase).
