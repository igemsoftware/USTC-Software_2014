SUBSTRATE   erythro-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate [CPD:C03961]
PRODUCT     oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036];
            ammonia [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The enzyme, which was characterized from the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans NCIMB 8944, is highly specific for the L-isomer of erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate. Different from EC 4.3.1.16, threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase and EC 4.3.1.27, threo-3-hydroxy-D-aspartate ammonia-lyase. Requires a divalent cation such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+.
HISTORY     EC 4.3.1.20 created 1972 as EC 4.2.1.38, transferred 2001 to EC 4.3.1.20, modified 2011
