NAME        glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     sinapoyl-CoA:glucarate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase
REACTION    sinapoyl-CoA + glucarate = CoA + O-sinapoylglucarate [RN:R02899]
ALL_REAC    R02899
SUBSTRATE   sinapoyl-CoA [CPD:C00411];
            glucarate [CPD:C00818]
