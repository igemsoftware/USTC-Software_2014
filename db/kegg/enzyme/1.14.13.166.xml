ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.166              Enzyme
NAME        4-nitrocatechol 4-monooxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-nitrocatechol,NAD(P)H:oxygen 4-oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating, nitrite-forming)
REACTION    4-nitrocatechol + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone + nitrite + NAD(P)+ + H2O
SUBSTRATE   4-nitrocatechol [CPD:C02235];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone [CPD:C07103];
            nitrite [CPD:C00088];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Contains FAD. The enzyme catalyses the oxidation of 4-nitrocatechol with the concomitant removal of the nitro group as nitrite. Forms a two-component system with a flavoprotein reductase [1]. The enzymes from the bacteria Lysinibacillus sphaericus JS905 and Rhodococcus sp. strain PN1 were shown to also catalyse EC 1.14.13.29, 4-nitrophenol 2-monooxygenase [1,2] while the enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. WBC-3 was shown to also catalyse EC 1.14.13.167, 4-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase [3].
