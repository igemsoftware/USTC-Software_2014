NAME        glycosphingolipid deacylase;
            glycosphingolipid ceramide deacylase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In linear amides
SYSNAME     glycosphingolipid amidohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of gangliosides and neutral glycosphingolipids, releasing fatty acids to form the lyso-derivatives
COMMENT     Does not act on sphingolipids such as ceramide. Not identical with EC 3.5.1.23 ceramidase.
