ENTRY       EC 1.13.12.9                Enzyme
NAME        phenylalanine 2-monooxygenase;
            L-phenylalanine oxidase (deaminating and decarboxylating);
            phenylalanine (deaminating, decarboxylating)oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases or internal mixed-function oxidases)
SYSNAME     L-phenylalanine:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    L-phenylalanine + O2 = 2-phenylacetamide + CO2 + H2O [RN:R00690]
ALL_REAC    R00690
SUBSTRATE   L-phenylalanine [CPD:C00079];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2-phenylacetamide [CPD:C02505];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The reaction shown above is about 80% of the reaction catalysed; the remaining 20% is: L-phenylalanine + O2 + H2O = 3-phenylpyruvic acid + ammonia + H2O2 a reaction similar to that of EC 1.4.3.2, L-amino-acid oxidase.
