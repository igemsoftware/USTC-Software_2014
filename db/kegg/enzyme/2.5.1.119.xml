NAME        beta-(isoxazolin-5-on-4-yl)-L-alanine synthase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     O3-acetyl-L-serine:isoxazolin-5-one 4-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)transferase
REACTION    O3-acetyl-L-serine + isoxazolin-5-one = 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine + acetate
SUBSTRATE   O3-acetyl-L-serine [CPD:C00979];
            isoxazolin-5-one
PRODUCT     3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine;
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     3-(5-Oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine is an antifungal antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces platensis. The enzymes from the plants Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea), L. sativus (grass pea) and Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) that catalyse EC 2.5.1.118 (beta-(isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl)-L-alanine synthase) also catalyse this reaction in vitro, but not in vivo. Closely related and possibly identical to EC 2.5.1.47, cysteine synthase, and EC 2.5.1.51, beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase.
