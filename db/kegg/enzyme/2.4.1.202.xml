COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the detoxification of the benzoxazinoids DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) and DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) which are stored as the respective non-toxic glucosides in the vacuoles in some plants, most commonly from the family of Poaceae (grasses). Benzoxazinoids are known to exhibit antimicrobial, antifeedant, and antiinsecticidal effects and are involved in the interaction of plants with other plants, insects, or microorganisms.
