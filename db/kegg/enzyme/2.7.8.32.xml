NAME        3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase;
            XPT1
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Transferases for other substituted phosphate groups
SYSNAME     UDP-D-xylose:3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase
REACTION    UDP-xylose + 3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose = UMP + 3-O-(6-O-alpha-D-xylosylphospho-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranose [RN:R09642]
ALL_REAC    R09642
SUBSTRATE   UDP-xylose [CPD:C00190];
            3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose [CPD:C19773]
PRODUCT     UMP [CPD:C00105];
            3-O-(6-O-alpha-D-xylosylphospho-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranose [CPD:C19774]
COMMENT     Mn2+ required for activity. The enzyme is specific for mannose as an acceptor but is flexible as to the structural context of the mannosyl disaccharide.
