ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.77                 Enzyme
NAME        nucleoside phosphotransferase;
            nonspecific nucleoside phosphotransferase;
            nucleotide:3'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphotransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     nucleotide:nucleoside 5'-phosphotransferase
REACTION    a nucleotide + a 2'-deoxynucleoside = a nucleoside + a 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate [RN:R07341]
ALL_REAC    R07341 > R02934 R05304
SUBSTRATE   nucleotide [CPD:C00215];
            2'-deoxynucleoside [CPD:C02269]
PRODUCT     nucleoside [CPD:C00801];
            2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate [CPD:C00676]
COMMENT     Phenyl phosphate and nucleoside 3'-phosphates can act as donors, although not so well as nucleoside 5'-phosphates. Nucleosides as well as 2'-deoxynucleosides can act as acceptors.
