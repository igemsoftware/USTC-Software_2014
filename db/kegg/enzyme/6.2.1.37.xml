NAME        3-hydroxybenzoate---CoA ligase;
            3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA synthetase;
            3-hydroxybenzoate---coenzyme A ligase (AMP-forming);
            3-hydroxybenzoyl coenzyme A synthetase;
            3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA ligase
CLASS       Ligases;
            Forming carbon-sulfur bonds;
            Acid-thiol ligases
SYSNAME     3-hydroxybenzoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming)
REACTION    ATP + 3-hydroxybenzoate + CoA = AMP + diphosphate + 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA [RN:R09589]
ALL_REAC    R09589
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            3-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00587];
            CoA [CPD:C00010]
PRODUCT     AMP [CPD:C00020];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA [CPD:C05195]
COMMENT     The enzyme works equally well with 4-hydroxybenzoate but shows low activity towards benzoate, 4-aminobenzoate, 3-aminobenzoate, 3-fluorobenzoate, 4-fluorobenzoate, 3-chlorobenzoate, and 4-chlorobenzoate. There is no activity with 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, and 2-hydroxybenzoate as substrates.
