ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.80               Enzyme
NAME        (R)-limonene 6-monooxygenase;
            (+)-limonene-6-hydroxylase;
            (+)-limonene 6-monooxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (R)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-hydroxylating)
REACTION    (R)-limonene + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (+)-trans-carveol + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R06119]
ALL_REAC    R06119
SUBSTRATE   (R)-limonene;
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (+)-trans-carveol [CPD:C11409];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The reaction is stereospecific with over 95% yield of (+)-trans-carveol from (R)-limonene. (S)-Limonene, the substrate for EC 1.14.13.48, (S)-limonene 6-monooxygenase, is not a substrate. Forms part of the carvone biosynthesis pathway in Carum carvi (caraway) seeds.
