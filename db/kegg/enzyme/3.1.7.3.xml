            monoterpenyl-pyrophosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Diphosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     monoterpenyl-diphosphate diphosphohydrolase
REACTION    a monoterpenyl diphosphate + H2O = a monoterpenol + diphosphate [RN:R03016]

SUBSTRATE   monoterpenyl diphosphate [CPD:C03517];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     monoterpenol [CPD:C00863];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     A group of enzymes with varying specificity for the monoterpenol moiety. One has the highest activity on sterically hindered compounds such as (+)-bornyl diphosphate; another has highest activity on the diphosphates of primary allylic alcohols such as geraniol.
