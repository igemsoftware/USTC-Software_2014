NAME        2-oxo-acid reductase;
            (2R)-hydroxycarboxylate-viologen-oxidoreductase;
            HVOR;
            2-oxoacid reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     (2R)-hydroxy-carboxylate:acceptor oxidoreductase
REACTION    a (2R)-hydroxy-carboxylate + acceptor = a 2-oxo-carboxylate + reduced acceptor [RN:R07155]
ALL_REAC    R07155
SUBSTRATE   (R)-2-hydroxycarboxylate [CPD:C02489];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     2-oxocarboxylate [CPD:C00161];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     Contains [4Fe-4S] and a mononucleotide molybdenum (pyranopterin) cofactor. Has broad substrate specificity, with 2-oxo-monocarboxylates and 2-oxo-dicarboxylates acting as substrates. Branching in a substrate at the C-3 position results in loss of activity. The enzyme from Proteus sp. is inactivated by oxygen.
