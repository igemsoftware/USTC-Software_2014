NAME        maleimide hydrolase;
            imidase;
            cyclic imide hydrolase;
            cyclic-imide amidohydrolase (decyclicizing) [misprint]
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In cyclic amides
SYSNAME     cyclic-imide amidohydrolase (decyclizing)
REACTION    maleimide + H2O = maleamic acid [RN:R05781]
ALL_REAC    R05781
SUBSTRATE   maleimide [CPD:C07272];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     maleamic acid [CPD:C01596]
COMMENT     Succinimide and glutarimide, and sulfur-containing cyclic imides, such as rhodanine, can also act as substrates for the enzyme from Blastobacter sp. A17p-4. The reverse, cyclization, reaction is also catalysed, but much more slowly. It has lower activity towards cyclic ureides, which are the substrates of EC 3.5.2.2, dihydropyrimidinase.
