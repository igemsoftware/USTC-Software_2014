ENTRY       EC 3.4.22.2                 Enzyme
NAME        papain;
            papayotin;
            summetrin;
            velardon;
            papaine;
            Papaya peptidase I
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Cysteine endopeptidases
REACTION    Hydrolysis of proteins with broad specificity for peptide bonds, but preference for an amino acid bearing a large hydrophobic side chain at the P2 position. Does not accept Val in P1'
COMMENT     Type example of peptidase family C1 from latex of the papaya (Carica papaya) fruit. Inhibited by compound E-64 and proteins of the cystatin family.
