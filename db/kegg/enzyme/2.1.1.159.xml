NAME        theobromine synthase;
            monomethylxanthine methyltransferase;
            MXMT;
            CTS1;
            CTS2;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-methylxanthine 3-N-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-methylxanthine N3-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 7-methylxanthine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,7-dimethylxanthine [RN:R07919]
ALL_REAC    R07919
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            7-methylxanthine [CPD:C16353]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            3,7-dimethylxanthine [CPD:C07480]
COMMENT     This is the third enzyme in the caffeine-biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme can also catalyse the conversion of paraxanthine into caffeine, although the paraxanthine pathway is considered to be a minor pathway for caffeine biosynthesis [2,3].
