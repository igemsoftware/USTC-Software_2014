NAME        deoxycytidylate C-methyltransferase;
            deoxycytidylate methyltransferase;
            dCMP methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dCMP C-methyltransferase
REACTION    5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + dCMP = dihydrofolate + deoxy-5-methylcytidylate [RN:R01670]
ALL_REAC    R01670
SUBSTRATE   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate [CPD:C00143];
            dCMP [CPD:C00239]
PRODUCT     dihydrofolate [CPD:C00415];
            deoxy-5-methylcytidylate [CPD:C03495]
COMMENT     dCMP is methylated by formaldehyde in the presence of tetrahydrofolate. CMP, dCTP and CTP can act as acceptors, but more slowly.
