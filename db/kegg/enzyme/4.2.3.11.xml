ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.11                 Enzyme
NAME        sabinene-hydrate synthase;
            sabinene hydrate cyclase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, sabinene-hydrate-forming)
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate + H2O = sabinene hydrate + diphosphate [RN:R02006]
ALL_REAC    R02006
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
