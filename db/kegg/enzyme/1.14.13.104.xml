NAME        (+)-menthofuran synthase;
            menthofuran synthase;
            (+)-pulegone 9-hydroxylase;
            (+)-MFS;
            cytochrome P450 menthofuran synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (+)-pulegone,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (9-hydroxylating)
REACTION    (+)-pulegone + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (+)-menthofuran + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R08923]
ALL_REAC    R08923
SUBSTRATE   (+)-pulegone [CPD:C09893];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (+)-menthofuran [CPD:C18025];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). The conversion of substrate into product involves the hydroxylation of the syn-methyl (C9), intramolecular cyclization to the hemiketal and dehydration to the furan [1]. This is the second cytochrome P-450-mediated step of monoterpene metabolism in peppermint, with the other step being catalysed by EC 1.14.13.47, (S)-limonene 3-monooxygenase [1].
