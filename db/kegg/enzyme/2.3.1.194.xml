NAME        acetoacetyl-CoA synthase;
            NphT7
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:malonyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA = acetoacetyl-CoA + CoA + CO2 [RN:R09527]
ALL_REAC    R09527
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            malonyl-CoA [CPD:C00083]
PRODUCT     acetoacetyl-CoA [CPD:C00332];
            CoA [CPD:C00010];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. CL190 produces acetoacetyl-CoA to be used for mevalonate production via the mevalonate pathway.
            Unlike the homologous EC 2.3.1.180 (beta-ketoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase III), this enzyme does not accept malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] as a substrate.
