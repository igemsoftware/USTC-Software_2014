NAME        alkan-1-ol dehydrogenase (acceptor);
            polyethylene glycol dehydrogenase;
            alkan-1-ol:(acceptor) oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     alkan-1-ol:acceptor oxidoreductase
REACTION    primary alcohol + acceptor = aldehyde + reduced acceptor [RN:R00639]
ALL_REAC    R00639
SUBSTRATE   primary alcohol [CPD:C00226];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     aldehyde [CPD:C00071];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A quinoprotein. Acts on C3-C16 linear-chain saturated primary alcohols, C4-C7 aldehydes and on non-ionic surfactants containing polyethylene glycol residues, such as Tween 40 and 60, but not on methanol and only very slowly on ethanol. 2,6-Dichloroindophenol can act as acceptor. cf. EC 1.1.99.8 alcohol dehydrogenase (acceptor).
