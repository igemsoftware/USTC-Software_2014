ENTRY       EC 3.1.3.44                 Enzyme
NAME        [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     [acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)]-phosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphate + H2O = [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] + phosphate [RN:R03273]
ALL_REAC    R03273
SUBSTRATE   [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphate [CPD:C01247];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] [CPD:C01139];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     Simultaneously dephosphorylates and activates EC 6.4.1.2 acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Acts similarly on EC 1.1.1.88 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase), EC 2.4.1.1 (phosphorylase), EC 2.4.1.11 [glycogen(starch) synthase], and dephosphorylates phosphoprotamine and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Not identical to EC 3.1.3.17 ([phosphorylase] phosphatase ) or EC 3.1.3.43 {[pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)]-phosphatase}.
