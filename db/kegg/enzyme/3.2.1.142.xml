ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.142                Enzyme
NAME        limit dextrinase;
            R-enzyme;
            amylopectin-1,6-glucosidase;
            dextrin alpha-1,6-glucanohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     dextrin 6-alpha-glucanohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in alpha- and beta-limit dextrins of amylopectin and glycogen, and in amylopectin and pullulan
COMMENT     Plant enzymes with little or no action on glycogen. Action on amylopectin is incomplete, but action on alpha-limit dextrins is complete. Maltose is the smallest sugar it can release from an alpha-(1->6)-linkage.
