NAME        mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase;
            MggA
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     GDP-mannose:2-O-(alpha-D-glucosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate 2-O-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase
REACTION    GDP-mannose + 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate = GDP + 2-O-[2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-phospho-D-glycerate [RN:R09667]
ALL_REAC    R09667
SUBSTRATE   GDP-mannose [CPD:C00096];
            2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate [CPD:C19791]
PRODUCT     GDP [CPD:C00035];
            2-O-[2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-phospho-D-glycerate [CPD:C19793]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in synthesis of 2-[2-O-(alpha-D-mannopranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-glycerate. Petrotoga miotherma and Petrotoga mobilis accumulate this compound in response to water stress imposed by salt.
