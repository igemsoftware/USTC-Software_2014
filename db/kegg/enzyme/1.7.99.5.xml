ENTRY       EC 1.7.99.5       Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Deleted entry
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors;
            With other acceptors
COMMENT     Deleted entry: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2). Now included with EC 1.5.1.20, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [NAD(P)H]. Based on the reference, it had been thought that this was a separate enzyme from EC 1.5.1.20 but the reference upon which the entry was based has since been disproved
HISTORY     EC 1.7.99.5 created 1965 as EC 1.1.1.68, transferred 1978 to EC 1.1.99.15, transferred 1980 to EC 1.7.99.5, deleted 2005
