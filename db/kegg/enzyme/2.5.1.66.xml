            glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:L-arginine 2-N-(2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl) transferase (2-carboxyethyl-forming)
CLASS       Transferases;

SYSNAME     glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:L-arginine N2-(2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl) transferase (2-carboxyethyl-forming)
REACTION    D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + L-arginine = N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine + phosphate [RN:R05465]
ALL_REAC    R05465
SUBSTRATE   D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [CPD:C00118];
            L-arginine [CPD:C00062]
PRODUCT     N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine [CPD:C06655];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     The enzyme requires thiamine diphosphate and catalyses the first step in the clavulanic-acid-biosynthesis pathway. The 2-hydroxy-3-oxo group transferred from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is isomerized during transfer to form the 2-carboxyethyl group.
