SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:25S rRNA (adenine2142-N1)-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine2142 in 25S rRNA = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine2142 in 25S rRNA [RN:R10497]
ALL_REAC    R10497
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            adenine2142 in 25S rRNA
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            N1-methyladenine2142 in 25S rRNA
COMMENT     In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae this methylation is important for resistance towards hydrogen peroxide and the antibiotic anisomycin.
