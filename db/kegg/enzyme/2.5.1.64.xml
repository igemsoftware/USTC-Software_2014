ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.64       Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Transferred to 2.2.1.9 and 4.2.99.20
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
COMMENT     Transferred entry: 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase. The reaction that was attributed to this enzyme is now known to be catalysed by two separate enzymes: EC 2.2.1.9 (2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic-acid synthase) and EC 4.2.99.20 (2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase)
HISTORY     EC 2.5.1.64 created 2003, deleted 2008
