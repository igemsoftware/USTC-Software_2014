NAME        1,6-alpha-L-fucosidase;
            alpha-L-fucosidase;
            1,6-L-fucosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylglycopeptide fucohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     6-L-fucosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylglycopeptide fucohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->6)-linkages between alpha-L-fucose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in glycopeptides such as immunoglobulin G glycopeptide and fucosyl-asialo-agalacto-fetuin
COMMENT     The enzyme from Aspergillus niger does not act on 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,4-L-fucosyl linkages.
