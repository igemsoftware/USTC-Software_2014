ENTRY       EC 1.2.3.4                  Enzyme
NAME        oxalate oxidase;
            aero-oxalo dehydrogenase;
            oxalic acid oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     oxalate:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    oxalate + O2 + 2 H+ = 2 CO2 + H2O2 [RN:R00273]
ALL_REAC    R00273
SUBSTRATE   oxalate [CPD:C00209];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     Contains Mn2+ as a cofactor. The enzyme is not a flavoprotein as had been thought [3].
