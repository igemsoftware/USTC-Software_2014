SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate 3-geranyltransferase
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate + 4-hydroxybenzoate = 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate + diphosphate [RN:R09040]
ALL_REAC    R09040
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341];
            4-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00156]
PRODUCT     3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate;
