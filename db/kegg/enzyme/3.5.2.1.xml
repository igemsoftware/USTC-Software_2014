ENTRY       EC 3.5.2.1                  Enzyme
NAME        barbiturase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In cyclic amides
SYSNAME     barbiturate amidohydrolase (3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate-forming)
REACTION    barbiturate + H2O = 3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate [RN:R02139]
ALL_REAC    R02139;
            (other) R03870
SUBSTRATE   barbiturate [CPD:C00813];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate [CPD:C15607]
COMMENT     Contains zinc and is specific for barbiturate as substrate [3]. Forms part of the oxidative pyrimidine-degrading pathway in some microorganisms, along with EC 1.17.99.4 (uracil/thymine dehydrogenase) and EC 3.5.1.95 (N-malonylurea hydrolase). It was previously thought that the end-products of the reaction were malonate and urea but this has since been disproved [2]. May be involved in the regulation of pyrimidine metabolism, along with EC 2.4.2.9, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase.
