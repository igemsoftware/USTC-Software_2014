SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:25S rRNA (adenine645-N1)-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine645 in 25S rRNA = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine645 in 25S rRNA [RN:R10497]
ALL_REAC    R10497
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            adenine645 in 25S rRNA
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            N1-methyladenine645 in 25S rRNA
COMMENT     The enzyme is found in eukaryotes. The adenine position refers to rRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the enzyme is important for ribosome biogenesis.
