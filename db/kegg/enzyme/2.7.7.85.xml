NAME        diadenylate cyclase;
            cyclic-di-AMP synthase;
            dacA (gene name);
            disA (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Nucleotidyltransferases
SYSNAME     ATP:ATP adenylyltransferase (cyclizing)
REACTION    2 ATP = 2 diphosphate + cyclic di-3',5'-adenylate [RN:R10342]
ALL_REAC    R10342
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            cyclic di-3',5'-adenylate [CPD:C20565]
COMMENT     Cyclic di-3',5'-adenylate is a bioactive molecule produced by some bacteria and archaea, which may function as a secondary signalling molecule [1].
            The intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes secretes it into the host's cytosol, where it triggers a cytosolic pathway of innate immunity [2].
