            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            2-hydroxy-6-oxocyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA [CPD:C09825]
PRODUCT     3-hydroxypimeloyl-CoA [CPD:C06714];
            2-hydroxy-6-oxocyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA [CPD:C09825]
COMMENT     The enzyme, which participates in the anaerobic benzoyl-CoA degradation pathway in certain organisms, catalyses the addition of one molecule of water to the double bound of 6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA followed by the hydrolytic C-C cleavage of the alicyclic ring.
