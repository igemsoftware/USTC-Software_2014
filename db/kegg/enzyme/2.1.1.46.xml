NAME        isoflavone 4'-O-methyltransferase;
            4'-hydroxyisoflavone methyltransferase;
            isoflavone methyltransferase;
            isoflavone O-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:4'-hydroxyisoflavone 4'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + a 4'-hydroxyisoflavone = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + a 4'-methoxyisoflavone
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            4'-hydroxyisoflavone
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            4'-methoxyisoflavone
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+ for activity. The enzyme catalyses the methylation of daidzein and genistein. It does not methylate naringenin, apigenin, luteolin or kaempferol.
