NAME        2'-hydroxydaidzein reductase;
            NADPH:2'-hydroxydaidzein oxidoreductase;
            HDR;
            2'-hydroxydihydrodaidzein:NADP+ 2'-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein:NADP+ 2'-oxidoreductase
REACTION    2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein + NADP+ = 2'-hydroxydaidzein + NADPH + H+ [RN:R03962]
ALL_REAC    R03962
SUBSTRATE   2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein [CPD:C03567];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     2'-hydroxydaidzein [CPD:C02495];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     In the reverse reaction, the 2'-hydroxyisoflavone (2'-hydroxydaidzein) is reduced to an isoflavanone. Also acts on 2'-hydroxyformononetin and to a small extent on 2'-hydroxygenistein. Involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin glyceollin. The isoflavones biochanin A, daidzein and genestein as well as the flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol and quercetin do not act as substrates.
