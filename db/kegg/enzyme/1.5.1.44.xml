ENTRY       EC 1.5.1.44                 Enzyme
NAME        festuclavine dehydrogenase;
            FgaFS;
            festuclavine synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-NH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     festuclavine:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    festuclavine + NAD+ = 6,8-dimethyl-6,7-didehydroergoline + NADH + H+ [RN:R10163]
ALL_REAC    R10163
SUBSTRATE   festuclavine [CPD:C20408];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     6,8-dimethyl-6,7-didehydroergoline [CPD:C20409];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of fumigaclavine C, an ergot alkaloid produced by some fungi of the Trichocomaceae family. The reaction proceeds in vivo in the opposite direction to the one shown here.
