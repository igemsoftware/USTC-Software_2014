SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            dCMP [CPD:C00239]

            dCDP [CPD:C00705]
COMMENT     The prokaryotic cytidine monophosphate kinase specifically phosphorylates CMP (or dCMP), using ATP as the preferred phosphoryl donor. Unlike EC 2.7.4.14, a eukaryotic enzyme that phosphorylates UMP and CMP with similar efficiency, the prokaryotic enzyme phosphorylates UMP with very low rates, and this function is catalysed in prokaryotes by EC 2.7.4.22, UMP kinase. The enzyme phosphorylates dCMP nearly as well as it does CMP [1].
