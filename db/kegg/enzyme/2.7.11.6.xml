ENTRY       EC 2.7.11.6                 Enzyme
NAME        [tyrosine 3-monooxygenase] kinase;
            pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase-associated kinase;
            STK4;
            tyrosine 3-monooxygenase kinase (phosphorylating)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Protein-serine/threonine kinases
SYSNAME     ATP:[tyrosine-3-monoxygenase] phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + [tyrosine-3-monooxygenase] = ADP + phospho-[tyrosine-3-monooxygenase]
ALL_REAC    (other) R04275
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            [tyrosine-3-monooxygenase]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phospho-[tyrosine-3-monooxygenase]
COMMENT     The enzyme has no activating compound but is specific for its substrate, with which it co-purifies. Requires Mg2+. Activates EC 1.14.16.2, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, by phosphorylation.
HISTORY     EC 2.7.11.6 created 1989 as EC 2.7.1.124, transferred 2005 to EC 2.7.11.6
