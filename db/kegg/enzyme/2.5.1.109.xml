SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:brevianamide-F tert-dimethylallyl-C-2-transferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + brevianamide F = diphosphate + deoxybrevianamide E [RN:R10456]
ALL_REAC    R10456
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            brevianamide F [CPD:C20563]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            deoxybrevianamide E [CPD:C20636]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the fungus Aspergilus sp. MF297-2 is specific for brevianamide F [1], while the enzyme from Aspergillus versicolor accepts a broad range of trytophan-containing cyclic dipeptides [2]. Involved in the biosynthetic pathways of several indole alkaloids such as paraherquamides and malbrancheamides.
