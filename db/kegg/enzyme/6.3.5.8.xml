ENTRY       EC 6.3.5.8        Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Transferred to 2.6.1.85
CLASS       Ligases;
            Forming carbon-nitrogen bonds;
            Carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor
COMMENT     Transferred entry: aminodeoxychorismate synthase. Now EC 2.6.1.85, aminodeoxychorismate synthase. As ATP is not hydrolysed during the reaction, the classification of the enzyme as a ligase was incorrect
HISTORY     EC 6.3.5.8 created 2003, deleted 2007
