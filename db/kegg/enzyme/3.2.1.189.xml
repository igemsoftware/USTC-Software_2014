NAME        dioscin glycosidase (diosgenin-forming);
            dioscin glycosidase (aglycone-forming)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     3-O-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->2)]-beta-D-Glc]diosgenin hydrolase (diosgenin-forming)
REACTION    3-O-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->2)]-beta-D-Glc]diosgenin + 3 H2O = D-glucose + 2 L-rhamnose + diosgenin [RN:R10581]
ALL_REAC    R10581
SUBSTRATE   3-O-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->2)]-beta-D-Glc]diosgenin [CPD:C08897];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     D-glucose [CPD:C00031];
            L-rhamnose [CPD:C00507];
            diosgenin [CPD:C08898]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in degradation of the steroid saponin dioscin by some fungi of the Absidia genus. The enzyme can also hydrolyse 3-O-[alpha-L-Ara-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Rha-(1->2)]-beta-D-Glc]diosgenin into diosgenin and free sugars as the final products. cf. EC 3.2.1.190, dioscin glycosidase (3-O-beta-D-Glc-diosgenin-forming).
