ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.301                Enzyme
NAME        D-arabitol-phosphate dehydrogenase;
            APDH;
            D-arabitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase;
            D-arabitol 5-phosphate dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     D-arabitol-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    D-arabitol 1-phosphate + NAD+ = D-xylulose 5-phosphate + NADH + H+ [RN:R09544]
ALL_REAC    R09544
SUBSTRATE   D-arabitol 1-phosphate [CPD:C19674];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003]
PRODUCT     D-xylulose 5-phosphate [CPD:C00231];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
