            UDP-glucose:xyloglucan 1,4-beta-D-glucosyltransferase

            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     UDP-glucose:xyloglucan 4-beta-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    Transfers a beta-D-glucosyl residue from UDP-glucose on to a glucose residue in xyloglucan, forming a beta-(1->4)-D-glucosyl-D-glucose linkage
COMMENT     In association with EC 2.4.2.39 (xyloglucan 6-xylosyltransferase), this enzyme brings about the synthesis of xyloglucan; concurrent transfers of glucose and xylose are essential for this synthesis. Not identical with EC 2.4.1.12 cellulose synthase (UDP-forming).
