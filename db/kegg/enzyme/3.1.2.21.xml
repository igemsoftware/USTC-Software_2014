SYSNAME     dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] hydrolase
REACTION    a dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + H2O = an [acyl-carrier protein] + dodecanoate [RN:R04014]
ALL_REAC    R04014
SUBSTRATE   dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] [CPD:C05223];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     [acyl-carrier protein] [CPD:C00229];
            dodecanoate [CPD:C02679]
COMMENT     Acts on the acyl-carrier-protein thioester of C12 and, with a much lower activity, C14 fatty acids. The derivative of oleic acid is hydrolysed very slowly (cf. EC 3.1.2.14, oleoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase).
