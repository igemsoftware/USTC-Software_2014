ENTRY       EC 1.1.99.7                 Enzyme
NAME        lactate---malate transhydrogenase;
            malate-lactate transhydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     (S)-lactate:oxaloacetate oxidoreductase
REACTION    (S)-lactate + oxaloacetate = pyruvate + malate [RN:R01447]
ALL_REAC    R01447
SUBSTRATE   (S)-lactate [CPD:C00186];
            oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036]
PRODUCT     pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            malate [CPD:C00149]
COMMENT     Catalyses hydrogen transfer from C3 or C4 (S)-2-hydroxy acids to 2-oxo acids. It contains tightly bound nicotinamide nucleotide in its active centre. This prosthetic group cannot be removed without denaturation of the protein.
