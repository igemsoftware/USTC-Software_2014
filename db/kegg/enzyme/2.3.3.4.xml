ENTRY       EC 2.3.3.4                  Enzyme
NAME        decylhomocitrate synthase;
            2-decylhomocitrate synthase;
            3-hydroxytetradecane-1,3,4-tricarboxylate 2-oxoglutarate-lyase (CoA-acylating)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Acyl groups converted into alkyl groups on transfer
SYSNAME     dodecanoyl-CoA:2-oxoglutarate C-dodecanoyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, 1-carboxyundecyl-forming)
REACTION    dodecanoyl-CoA + H2O + 2-oxoglutarate = (3S,4S)-3-hydroxytetradecane-1,3,4-tricarboxylate + CoA [RN:R03859]
ALL_REAC    R03859
SUBSTRATE   dodecanoyl-CoA [CPD:C01832];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026]
PRODUCT     (3S,4S)-3-hydroxytetradecane-1,3,4-tricarboxylate [CPD:C04529];
            CoA [CPD:C00010]
COMMENT     Decanoyl-CoA can act instead of dodecanoyl-CoA, but 2-oxoglutarate cannot be replaced by oxaloacetate or pyruvate.
HISTORY     EC 2.3.3.4 created 1976 as EC 4.1.3.29, transferred 2002 to EC 2.3.3.4
