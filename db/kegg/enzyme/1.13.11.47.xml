NAME        3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase;
            (1H)-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase;
            3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase;
            3-hydroxy-4(1H)-one, 2,4-dioxygenase;
            quinoline-3,4-diol 2,4-dioxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one 2,4-dioxygenase (CO-forming)
REACTION    3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one + O2 = N-formylanthranilate + CO [RN:R05719]
ALL_REAC    R05719;
            (other) R04915
SUBSTRATE   3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one [CPD:C11503];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     N-formylanthranilate [CPD:C05653];
            CO [CPD:C00237]
COMMENT     Does not contain a metal centre or organic cofactor. Fission of two C-C bonds: 2,4-dioxygenolytic cleavage with concomitant release of carbon monoxide. The enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is highly specific for this substrate.
