ENTRY       EC 5.1.1.19                 Enzyme
NAME        O-ureido-serine racemase;
            dcsC (gene name)
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Racemases and epimerases;
            Acting on amino acids and derivatives
SYSNAME     (2S)-2-amino-3-[(carbamoylamino)oxy]propanoate 2-epimerase
REACTION    O-ureido-L-serine = O-ureido-D-serine [RN:R10488]
ALL_REAC    R10488
SUBSTRATE   O-ureido-L-serine [CPD:C20639]
PRODUCT     O-ureido-D-serine [CPD:C20651]
COMMENT     The enzyme employs a two-base mechanism, with a thiolate-thiol pair in the active site. It participates in the biosynthetic pathway of D-cycloserine, an antibiotic substance produced by several Streptomyces species.
