NAME        1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase;
            CYP3A4
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     1,8-cineole,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-exo-hydroxylating)
REACTION    1,8-cineole + NADPH + H+ + O2 = 2-exo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R10076]
ALL_REAC    R10076
SUBSTRATE   1,8-cineole [CPD:C09844];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]

            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). The mammalian enzyme, expressed in liver microsomes, performs a variety of oxidation reactions of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. cf. EC 1.14.13.97 (taurochenodeoxycholate 6-hydroxylase), EC 1.14.13.67 (quinine 3-monooxygenase) and EC 1.14.13.32 (albendazole monooxygenase).
