ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.68                 Enzyme
NAME        glutamine N-acyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acyl-CoA:L-glutamine N-acyltransferase
REACTION    acyl-CoA + L-glutamine = CoA + N-acyl-L-glutamine [RN:R00577]
ALL_REAC    R00577
SUBSTRATE   acyl-CoA [CPD:C00040];
            L-glutamine [CPD:C00064]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            N-acyl-L-glutamine [CPD:C02716]
COMMENT     Phenylacetyl-CoA and (indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA, but not benzoyl-CoA, can act as acyl donors. Not identical with EC 2.3.1.13 glycine N-acyltransferase or EC 2.3.1.71 glycine N-benzoyltransferase.
