NAME        carboxylate reductase;
            aldehyde:(acceptor) oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     aldehyde:acceptor oxidoreductase
REACTION    an aldehyde + acceptor + H2O = a carboxylate + reduced acceptor [RN:R00544]
ALL_REAC    R00544 > R00326 R00638
SUBSTRATE   aldehyde [CPD:C00071];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     carboxylate [CPD:C00060];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     A tungsten protein. Methyl viologen can act as acceptor. In the reverse direction, non-activated acids are reduced by reduced viologens to aldehydes, but not to the corresponding alcohols.
