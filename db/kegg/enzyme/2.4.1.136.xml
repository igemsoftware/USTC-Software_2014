ENTRY       EC 2.4.1.136                Enzyme
NAME        gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase;
            UDP-glucose---vanillate 1-glucosyltransferase;
            UDPglucose:vanillate 1-O-glucosyltransferase;
            UDPglucose:gallate glucosyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     UDP-glucose:gallate beta-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    UDP-glucose + gallate = UDP + 1-galloyl-beta-D-glucose [RN:R03297]
ALL_REAC    R03297
SUBSTRATE   UDP-glucose [CPD:C00029];
            gallate [CPD:C01424]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            1-galloyl-beta-D-glucose [CPD:C01158]
COMMENT     A number of substituted benzoic acids and, more slowly, cinnamic acids, can act as acceptors. Vanillin is the best acceptor investigated.
