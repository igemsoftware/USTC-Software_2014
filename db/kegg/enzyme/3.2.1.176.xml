SYSNAME     4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase (reducing end)
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and similar substrates, releasing cellobiose from the reducing ends of the chains.
COMMENT     Some exocellulases, most of which belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 48 (GH48, formerly known as cellulase family L), act at the reducing ends of cellulose and similar substrates. The CelS enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum is the most abundant subunit of the cellulosome formed by the organism. It liberates cellobiose units from the reducing end by hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond, employing an inverting reaction mechanism [2]. Different from EC 3.2.1.91, which attacks cellulose from the non-reducing end.
