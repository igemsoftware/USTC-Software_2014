NAME        xyloglucan-specific exo-beta-1,4-glucanase;
            Cel74A
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     [(1->6)-alpha-D-xylo]-(1->4)-beta-D-glucan exo-glucohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->4)-D-glucosidic linkages in xyloglucans so as to successively remove oligosaccharides from the chain end.
COMMENT     The enzyme removes XXXG heptasaccharides, XXLG/XLXG octasaccharides and XLLG nonasaccharides from the end of tamarind seed xyloglucan polymers in a processive manner. Hydrolysis occurs at the unsubstituted D-glucopyranose residue in the main backbone. It is not known whether the cleavage takes place at the reducing or non-reducing end of the polymer. Very low activity with beta-D-glucans. The enzyme from Chrysosporium lucknowense shifts to an endoglucanase mode when acting on linear substrates without bulky substituents on the polymeric backbone such as barley beta-glucan.
