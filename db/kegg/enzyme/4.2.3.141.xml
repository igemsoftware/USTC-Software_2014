NAME        sclareol synthase;
            SS
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (13E)-8alpha-hydroxylabd-13-en-15-yl-diphosphate-lyase (sclareol forming)
REACTION    (13E)-8alpha-hydroxylabd-13-en-15-yl diphosphate + H2O = sclareol + diphosphate [RN:R10241]
ALL_REAC    R10241
SUBSTRATE   (13E)-8alpha-hydroxylabd-13-en-15-yl diphosphate [CPD:C20270];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     sclareol [CPD:C09183];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Isolated from the plant Salvia sclarea (clary sage). Originally thought to be synthesized in one step from geranylgeranyl diphosphate it is now known to require two enzymes, EC 4.2.1.133, copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase and EC 4.2.3.141, sclareol synthase. Sclareol is used in perfumery.
