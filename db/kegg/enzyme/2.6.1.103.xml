SYSNAME     (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase
REACTION    (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine + 2-oxoglutarate = 2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoacetate + L-glutamate [RN:R06634]
ALL_REAC    R06634
SUBSTRATE   (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine [CPD:C12026];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026]
PRODUCT     2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoacetate [CPD:C12325];
            L-glutamate [CPD:C00025]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-5'-phosphate protein. The enzyme from the bacterium Amycolatopsis orientalis catalyses the reaction in the reverse direction as part of the biosynthesis of the (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine constituent of the glycopeptide antibiotic chloroeremomycin.
