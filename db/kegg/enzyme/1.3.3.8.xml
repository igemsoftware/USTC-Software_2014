ENTRY       EC 1.3.3.8                  Enzyme
NAME        tetrahydroberberine oxidase;
            (S)-THB oxidase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     (S)-tetrahydroberberine:oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    (S)-tetrahydroberberine + 2 O2 = berberine + 2 H2O2 [RN:R02880]
ALL_REAC    R02880;
            (other) R03722 R08795
SUBSTRATE   (S)-tetrahydroberberine [CPD:C03329];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     berberine [CPD:C00757];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Berberis sp. is a flavoprotein; that from Coptis japonica is not. (R)-Tetrahydroberberines are not oxidized.
