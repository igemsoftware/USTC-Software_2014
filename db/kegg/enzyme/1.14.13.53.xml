CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     formononetin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (2'-hydroxylating)

COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). Acts on isoflavones with a 4'-methoxy group, such as formononetin and biochanin A. Involved in the biosynthesis of the pterocarpin phytoalexins medicarpin and maackiain. EC 1.14.13.89, isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase, is less specific and acts on other isoflavones as well as 4'-methoxyisoflavones.
