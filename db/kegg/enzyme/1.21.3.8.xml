ENTRY       EC 1.21.3.8                 Enzyme
NAME        cannabidiolic acid synthase;
            CBDA synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     cannabigerolate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, cannabidiolate-forming)
REACTION    cannabigerolate + O2 = cannabidiolate + H2O2 [RN:R10160]
ALL_REAC    R10160
SUBSTRATE   cannabigerolate [CPD:C20406];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     cannabidiolate [CPD:C10784];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     Binds FAD covalently. Part of the cannabinoids biosynthetic pathway of the plant Cannabis sativa. The enzyme can also convert cannabinerolate to cannabidiolate with lower efficiency.
