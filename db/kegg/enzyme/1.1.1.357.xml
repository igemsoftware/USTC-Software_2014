COMMENT     The enzyme acts on multiple 3alpha-hydroxysteroids, such as androsterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. The mammalian enzymes are involved in inactivation of steroid hormones, while the bacterial enzymes are involved in steroid degradation. This entry stands for enzymes whose stereo-specificity with respect to NAD+ or NADP+ is not known. [cf. EC 1.1.1.50, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase (Si-specific) and EC 1.1.1.213, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase (Re-specific)].
