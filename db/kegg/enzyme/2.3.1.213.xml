            1-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose:cyanidin 3-O-(2"-O-xylosyl-6"-O-glucosylgalactoside) 6'''-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     1-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose:cyanidin 3-O-(6-O-beta-D-glucosyl-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside) 6'''-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase
REACTION    1-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose + cyanidin 3-O-(6-O-beta-D-glucosyl-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside) = beta-D-glucose + cyanidin 3-O-[6-O-(6-O-4-hydroxycinnamoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside] [RN:R10236]

SUBSTRATE   1-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose [CPD:C16827];
            cyanidin 3-O-(6-O-beta-D-glucosyl-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside) [CPD:C08612]
PRODUCT     beta-D-glucose [CPD:C00221];
            cyanidin 3-O-[6-O-(6-O-4-hydroxycinnamoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside] [CPD:C20460]
COMMENT     Isolated from the plant Daucus carota (Afghan cultivar carrot). In addition to 1-O-(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose, the enzyme can use the 1-O-sinapoyl- and 1-O-feruloyl- derivatives of beta-D-glucose.
