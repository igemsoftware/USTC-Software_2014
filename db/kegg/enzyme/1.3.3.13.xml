ENTRY       EC 1.3.3.13                 Enzyme
NAME        albonoursin synthase;
            cyclo(dipeptide):oxygen oxidoreductase;
            cyclic dipeptide oxidase;
            AlbA
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     cyclo(L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl):oxygen oxidoreductase
REACTION    cyclo(L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl) + 2 O2 = albonoursin + 2 H2O2 (overall reaction) [RN:R10329];
            (1a) cyclo(L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl) + O2 = cyclo[(Z)-alpha,beta-didehydrophenylalanyl-L-leucyl] + H2O2 [RN:R10327];
            (1b) cyclo[(Z)-alpha,beta-didehydrophenylalanyl-L-leucyl] + O2 = albonoursin + H2O2 [RN:R10328]
ALL_REAC    R10327 R10328 R10329
SUBSTRATE   cyclo(L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl) [CPD:C20519];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            cyclo[(Z)-alpha,beta-didehydrophenylalanyl-L-leucyl] [CPD:C20521]
PRODUCT     albonoursin [CPD:C20520];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027];
            cyclo[(Z)-alpha,beta-didehydrophenylalanyl-L-leucyl] [CPD:C20521]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein from the bacterium Streptomyces noursei. The enzyme can also oxidize several other cyclo dipeptides, the best being cyclo(L-tryptophyl-L-tryptophyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanyl) [1,2].
