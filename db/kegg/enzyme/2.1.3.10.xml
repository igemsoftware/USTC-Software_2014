SUBSTRATE   malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] [CPD:C01209];
            biotinyl-[protein] [CPD:C18046]
PRODUCT     acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein] [CPD:C03939];
            carboxybiotinyl-[protein] [CPD:C18047]
COMMENT     Derived from the components MadC and MadD of the anaerobic bacterium Malonomonas rubra, this enzyme is a component of EC 4.1.1.89, biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase. The carboxy group is transferred from malonate to the prosthetic group of the biotin protein (MadF) with retention of configuration [2]. Similar to EC 4.1.1.87, malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase, which forms part of the biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.88), this enzyme also follows on from EC 2.3.1.187, acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase, and results in the regeneration of the acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein] [3].
