COMMENT     A non-heme iron oxygenase. The enzyme from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida shares an NAD(P)H-FMN reductase subunit with EC 1.14.13.179, methylxanthine N3-demethylase, and has a 5-fold higher activity with NADH than with NADPH [2]. Also demethylate 1-methylxantine with lower efficiency. Forms part of the degradation pathway of methylxanthines.
