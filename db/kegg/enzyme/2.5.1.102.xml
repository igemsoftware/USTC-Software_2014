ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.102                Enzyme
NAME        geranyl-pyrophosphate---olivetolic acid geranyltransferase;
            GOT (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate + 2,4-dihydroxy-6-pentylbenzoate = diphosphate + cannabigerolate [RN:R10176]
ALL_REAC    R10176
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341];
            2,4-dihydroxy-6-pentylbenzoate [CPD:C20417]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            cannabigerolate [CPD:C20406]
COMMENT     Part of the cannabinoids biosynthetic pathway of the plant Cannabis sativa. The enzyme can also use neryl diphosphate as substrate, forming cannabinerolate.
