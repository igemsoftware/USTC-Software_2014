ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.321                Enzyme
NAME        benzil reductase [(R)-benzoin forming]
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-benzoin:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (R)-benzoin + NADP+ = benzil + NADPH + H+ [RN:R09933]
ALL_REAC    R09933
SUBSTRATE   (R)-benzoin [CPD:C20228];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     benzil [CPD:C20226];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae is able to reduce enantioselectively only one of the two carbonyl groups of benzil to give optically active (R)-benzoin.
