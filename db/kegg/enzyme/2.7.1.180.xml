ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.180                Enzyme
NAME        FAD:protein FMN transferase;
            flavin transferase;
            apbE (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     FAD:protein riboflavin-5'-phosphate transferase
REACTION    FAD + [protein]-L-threonine = [protein]-FMN-L-threonine + AMP [RN:R10613]
ALL_REAC    R10613
SUBSTRATE   FAD [CPD:C00016];
            [protein]-L-threonine [CPD:C19803]
PRODUCT     [protein]-FMN-L-threonine [CPD:C20730];
            AMP [CPD:C00020]
COMMENT     The enzyme catalyses the transfer of the FMN portion of FAD and its covalent binding to the hydroxyl group of an L-threonine residue in a target flavin-binding protein such as the B and C subunits of EC 1.6.5.8, NADH:ubiquinone reductase (Na+-transporting). Requires Mg2+.
