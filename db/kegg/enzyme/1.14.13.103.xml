ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.103              Enzyme
NAME        8-dimethylallylnaringenin 2'-hydroxylase;
            8-DMAN 2'-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     sophoraflavanone-B,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (2'-hydroxylating)
REACTION    sophoraflavanone B + NADPH + H+ + O2 = leachianone G + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R08922]
ALL_REAC    R08922
SUBSTRATE   sophoraflavanone B [CPD:C18023];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     leachianone G [CPD:C18024];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A membrane-bound heme-thiolate protein that is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum [1,2]. This enzyme is specific for sophoraflavanone B as substrate. NADPH cannot be replaced by NADH, FAD or FMN. Along with EC 2.5.1.70 (naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase) and EC 2.5.1.71 (leachianone G 2''-dimethylallyltransferase), this enzyme forms part of the sophoraflavanone-G-biosynthesis pathway. A member of the cytochrome-P450 monooxygenase family.
