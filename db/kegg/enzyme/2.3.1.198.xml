NAME        glycerol-3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase;
            sn-2-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase;
            glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol 3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase
REACTION    an acyl-CoA + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate = CoA + a 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate [RN:R06872]
ALL_REAC    R06872
SUBSTRATE   acyl-CoA [CPD:C00040];
            sn-glycerol 3-phosphate [CPD:C00093]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate [CPD:C03974]
COMMENT     A membrane-associated enzyme required for suberin or cutin synthesis in plants. Active with a wide range of acyl-CoA substrates (C16:0-C24:0). The enzyme from some sources has much higher activity with omega-oxidized acyl-CoAs. Some enzymes are bifunctional and have an additional phosphatase activity producing sn-2-monoacylglycerols.
