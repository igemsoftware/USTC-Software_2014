NAME        phenylpropanoylacetyl-CoA synthase;
            phenylpropanoyl-diketide-CoA synthase;
            DCS
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     phenylpropanoyl-CoA:malonyl-CoA phenylpropanoyl-transferase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    (1) feruloyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA = feruloylacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA [RN:R08806];
            (2) 4-coumaroyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA = (4-coumaroyl)acetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA [RN:R08805]
ALL_REAC    R08805 R08806
SUBSTRATE   feruloyl-CoA [CPD:C00406];
            malonyl-CoA [CPD:C00083];
            4-coumaroyl-CoA [CPD:C00223]
PRODUCT     feruloylacetyl-CoA [CPD:C17741];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            CoA [CPD:C00010];
            (4-coumaroyl)acetyl-CoA [CPD:C17740]
COMMENT     The enzyme has been characterized from the plant Curcuma longa (turmeric). It prefers feruloyl-CoA, and has no activity with cinnamoyl-CoA.
