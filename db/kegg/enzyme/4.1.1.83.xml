NAME        4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase;
            p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase;
            p-Hpd;
            4-Hpd;
            4-hydroxyphenylacetate carboxy-lyase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Carboxy-lyases
SYSNAME     4-(hydroxyphenyl)acetate carboxy-lyase (4-methylphenol-forming)
REACTION    (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate + H+ = 4-methylphenol + CO2 [RN:R07312]
ALL_REAC    R07312
SUBSTRATE   4-hydroxyphenylacetate [CPD:C00642];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     4-methylphenol [CPD:C01468];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     The enzyme, from the strict anaerobe Clostridium difficile, can also use (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetate as a substrate, yielding 4-methylcatechol as a product. The enzyme is a glycyl radical enzyme.
