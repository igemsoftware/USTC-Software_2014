ENTRY       EC 2.7.1.118                Enzyme
NAME        ADP---thymidine kinase;
            ADP:dThd phosphotransferase;
            adenosine diphosphate-thymidine phosphotransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ADP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase
REACTION    ADP + thymidine = AMP + dTMP [RN:R01568]
ALL_REAC    R01568
SUBSTRATE   ADP [CPD:C00008];
            thymidine [CPD:C00214]
PRODUCT     AMP [CPD:C00020];
            dTMP [CPD:C00364]
COMMENT     The deoxypyrimidine kinase complex induced by Herpes simplex virus catalyses this reaction as well as those of EC 2.7.1.21 (thymidine kinase), EC 2.7.1.114 (AMP---thymidine kinase) and EC 2.7.4.9 (dTMP kinase).
