NAME        flavonoid 3',5'-methyltransferase;
            AOMT;
            CrOMT2
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:flavonoid 3'-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + a 3'-hydroxyflavonoid = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + a 3'-methoxyflavonoid;
            (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + a 5'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyflavonoid = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + a 3',5'-dimethoxyflavonoid
ALL_REAC    (other) R06815 R06816
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            3'-hydroxyflavonoid [CPD:C02790];
            5'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyflavonoid
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            3'-methoxyflavonoid;
            3',5'-dimethoxyflavonoid
COMMENT     Isolated from Vitis vinifera (grape) [2]. Most active with delphinidin 3-glucoside but also acts on cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin, myricetin, quercetin and quercetin 3-glucoside. The enzyme from Catharanthus roseus was most active with myricetin [1].
