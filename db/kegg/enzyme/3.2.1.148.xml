ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.148      Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Deleted entry
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
COMMENT     Deleted entry: ribosylhomocysteinase. This enzyme was transferred to EC 3.13.1.2, 5-deoxyribos-5-ylhomocysteinase, which has since been deleted. The activity is most probably attributable to EC 4.4.1.21, S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase
HISTORY     EC 3.2.1.148 created 1972 as EC 3.3.1.3, transferred 2001 to EC 3.2.1.148, deleted 2004
