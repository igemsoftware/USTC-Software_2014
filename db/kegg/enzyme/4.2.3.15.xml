ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.15                 Enzyme
NAME        myrcene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (myrcene-forming)
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate = myrcene + diphosphate [RN:R02009]
ALL_REAC    R02009
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341]
PRODUCT     myrcene [CPD:C06074];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     A recombinant enzyme (also known as a monoterpene synthase or cyclase) from the grand fir (Abies grandis) requires Mn2+ and K+ for activity. Mg2+ is essentially ineffective as the divalent metal ion cofactor.
HISTORY     EC 4.2.3.15 created 2000 as EC 4.1.99.9, transferred 2000 to EC 4.2.3.15
