ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.149                Enzyme
NAME        beta-primeverosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside 6-O-(beta-D-xylosyl)-beta-D-glucohydrolase
REACTION    a 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside + H2O = 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose + an alcohol [RN:R05788]
ALL_REAC    R05788
SUBSTRATE   6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside [CPD:C11531];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose [CPD:C11535];
            alcohol [CPD:C00069]
COMMENT     The enzyme is responsible for the formation of the alcoholic aroma in oolong and black tea. In addition to beta-primeverosides [i.e. 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosides], it also hydrolyses 6-O-(beta-D-apiofuranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosides and, less rapidly, beta-vicianosides and 6-O-(alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosides, but not beta-glucosides. Geranyl-, linaloyl-, benzyl- and p-nitrophenol glycosides are all hydrolysed.
