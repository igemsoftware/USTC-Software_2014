ENTRY       EC 1.7.99.8                 Enzyme
NAME        hydrazine oxidoreductase;
            HAO (ambiguous;
            cf. EC 1.7.3.4 hydroxylamine oxidase)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     hydrazine:acceptor oxidoreductase
REACTION    hydrazine + acceptor = N2 + reduced acceptor [RN:R07174]
ALL_REAC    R07174
SUBSTRATE   hydrazine [CPD:C05361];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     N2 [CPD:C00697];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the pathway of anaerobic ammonium oxidation in anammox bacteria. The conversion of hydroxylamine by the enzyme from Brocadia anammoxidans results in the formation of NO and N2O [1]. Hydroxylamine is not a substrate for the enzyme from planctomycete KSU-1 [2].
