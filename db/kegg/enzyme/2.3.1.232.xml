SYSNAME     anthraniloyl-CoA:methanol O-anthraniloyltransferase
REACTION    anthraniloyl-CoA + methanol = CoA + O-methyl anthranilate [RN:R10681]

SUBSTRATE   anthraniloyl-CoA [CPD:C02247];
            methanol [CPD:C00132]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            O-methyl anthranilate [CPD:C20634]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Concord grape (Vitis labrusca) is solely responsible for the production of O-methyl anthranilate, an important aroma and flavor compound in the grape. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and can use a range of alcohols with substantial activity, the best being butanol, benzyl alcohol, iso-pentanol, octanol and 2-propanol. It can use benzoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA as acyl donors with lower efficiency. In addition to O-methyl anthranilate, the enzyme might be responsible for the production of ethyl butanoate, methyl-3-hydroxy butanoate and ethyl-3-hydroxy butanoate, which are present in large quantities in the grapes. Also catalyses EC 2.3.1.196, benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase.
