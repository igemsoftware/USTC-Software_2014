ENTRY       EC 1.7.6.1                  Enzyme
NAME        nitrite dismutase;
            Prolixin S;
            Nitrophorin 7
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors;
            With a nitrogenous group as acceptor
SYSNAME     nitrite:nitrite oxidoreductase
REACTION    3 nitrite + 2 H+ = 2 nitric oxide + nitrate + H2O [RN:R09751]
ALL_REAC    R09751
SUBSTRATE   nitrite [CPD:C00088];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     nitric oxide [CPD:C00533];
            nitrate [CPD:C00244];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Contains ferriheme b. The enzyme is one of the nitrophorins from the salivary gland of the blood-feeding insect Rhodnius prolixus. Nitric oxide produced induces vasodilation after injection. Nitrophorins 2 and 4 can also catalyse this reaction.
