NAME        aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH);
            aldose 6-phosphate reductase;
            NADP+-dependent aldose 6-phosphate reductase;

            aldose-6-phosphate reductase;
            alditol 6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase;
            aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     D-aldose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase
REACTION    D-sorbitol 6-phosphate + NADP+ = D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADPH + H+ [RN:R00834]
ALL_REAC    R00834
SUBSTRATE   D-sorbitol 6-phosphate [CPD:C01096];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     D-glucose 6-phosphate [CPD:C00092];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     In the reverse reaction, acts also on D-galactose 6-phosphate and, more slowly, on D-mannose 6-phosphate and 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate.
