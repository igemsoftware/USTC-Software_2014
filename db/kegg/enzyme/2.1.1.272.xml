ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.272                Enzyme
NAME        cobalt-factor III methyltransferase;
            CbiH60 (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cobalt-factor III 17-methyltransferase (ring contracting)
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cobalt-factor III + reduced acceptor = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + cobalt-precorrin-4 + acceptor
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            cobalt-factor III [CPD:C17401];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            cobalt-precorrin-4;
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
COMMENT     Isolated from Bacillus megaterium. The enzyme catalyses both methylation at C-17 and ring contraction. Contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. It can also convert cobalt-precorrin-3 to cobalt-precorrin-4. The reductant may be thioredoxin.
