ENTRY       EC 1.3.1.82                 Enzyme
NAME        (-)-isopiperitenone reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (+)-cis-isopulegone:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    (+)-cis-isopulegone + NADP+ = (-)-isopiperitenone + NADPH + H+ [RN:R06417]
ALL_REAC    R06417
SUBSTRATE   (+)-cis-isopulegone [CPD:C11951];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     (-)-isopiperitenone [CPD:C02485];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The reaction occurs in the opposite direction to that shown above. The enzyme participates in the menthol-biosynthesis pathway of Mentha plants. (+)-Pulegone, (+)-cis-isopulegone and (-)-menthone are not substrates. The enzyme has a preference for NADPH as the reductant, with NADH being a poor substitute [2]. The enzyme is highly regioselective for the reduction of the endocyclic 1,2-double bond, and is stereoselective, producing only the 1R-configured product. It is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.
