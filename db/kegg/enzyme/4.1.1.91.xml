NAME        salicylate decarboxylase;
            salicylic acid decarboxylase;
            Scd
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Carboxy-lyases
SYSNAME     salicylate carboxy-lyase
REACTION    salicylate = phenol + CO2 [RN:R09539]
ALL_REAC    R09539
SUBSTRATE   salicylate [CPD:C00805]
PRODUCT     phenol [CPD:C00146];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     In the reverse direction the enzyme catalyses the regioselective carboxylation of phenol into stoichiometric amounts of salicylate. The enzyme also catalyses the reversible decarboxylation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and 4-aminosalicylate [1].
