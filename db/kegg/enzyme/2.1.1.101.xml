ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.101                Enzyme
NAME        macrocin O-methyltransferase;
            macrocin methyltransferase;
            S-adenosyl-L-methionine-macrocin O-methyltransferase;
            MOMT (ambiguous);
            tylF (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:macrocin 3'''-O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + macrocin = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tylosin [RN:R02858]
ALL_REAC    R02858
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            macrocin [CPD:C00744]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            tylosin [CPD:C01457]
COMMENT     Requires Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+. The 3-hydroxy group of the 2-O-methyl-6-deoxy-D-allose moiety in the macrolide antibiotic macrosin acts as methyl acceptor, generating tylosin, another macrolide antibiotic. Isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces fradiae. Not identical with EC 2.1.1.102, demethylmacrocin O-methyltransferase.
