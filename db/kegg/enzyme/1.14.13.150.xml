ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.150              Enzyme
NAME        alpha-humulene 10-hydroxylase;
            CYP71BA1
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     alpha-humulene,NADPH:oxygen 10-oxidoreductase
REACTION    alpha-humulene + O2 + NADPH + H+ = 10-hydroxy-alpha-humulene + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R09934]
ALL_REAC    R09934
SUBSTRATE   alpha-humulene [CPD:C09684];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     10-hydroxy-alpha-humulene [CPD:C20229];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     Requires cytochrome P-450. The recommended numbering of humulene gives 10-hydroxy-alpha-humulene as the product rather than 8-hydroxy-alpha-humulene as used by the reference. See {iupac/sectionF/index::Section F: Natural Product Nomenclature}.
