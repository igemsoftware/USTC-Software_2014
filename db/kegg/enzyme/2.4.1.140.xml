SYSNAME     sucrose:(1->6)[(1->3)]-alpha-D-glucan 6(3)-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    Transfers alternately an alpha-D-glucosyl residue from sucrose to the 6-position and the 3-position of the non-reducing terminal residue of an alpha-D-glucan, thus producing a glucan having alternating alpha-(1->6)- and alpha-(1->3)-linkages
COMMENT     The product, which has quite different properties from other dextrans, has been called alternan.
