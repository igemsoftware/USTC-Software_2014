ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.16                 Enzyme
NAME        (4S)-limonene synthase;
            (-)-(4S)-limonene synthase;
            4S-(-)-limonene synthase;
            geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase (limonene forming);
            geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase [cyclizing, (4S)-limonene-forming];
            geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing;
            (-)-(4S)-limonene-forming]
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing; (S)-limonene-forming]
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate = (S)-limonene + diphosphate [RN:R02013]
ALL_REAC    R02013
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341]
PRODUCT     (S)-limonene;
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     A recombinant enzyme (also known as a monoterpene synthase or cyclase) from the grand fir (Abies grandis) requires Mn2+ and K+ for activity. Mg2+ is essentially ineffective as the divalent metal ion cofactor.
