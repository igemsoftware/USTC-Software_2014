ENTRY       EC 3.1.26.10                Enzyme
NAME        ribonuclease IX;
            poly(U)- and poly(C)-specific endoribonuclease
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Endoribonucleases producing 5'-phosphomonoesters
REACTION    Endonucleolytic cleavage of poly(U) or poly(C) to fragments terminated by 3'-hydroxy and 5'-phosphate groups
COMMENT     Acts on poly(U) and poly(C), with a higher affinity for poly(C), but does not act on poly(A) or poly(G).
