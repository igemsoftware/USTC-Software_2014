ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.132                Enzyme
NAME        glucarolactone O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     sinapoyl-CoA:glucarolactone O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase
REACTION    sinapoyl-CoA + glucarolactone = CoA + O-sinapoylglucarolactone [RN:R03861]
ALL_REAC    R03861
SUBSTRATE   sinapoyl-CoA [CPD:C00411];
            glucarolactone
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            O-sinapoylglucarolactone [CPD:C03526]
COMMENT     4-Coumaroyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA can also act as donors, but more slowly.
