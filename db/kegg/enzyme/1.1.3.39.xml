ENTRY       EC 1.1.3.39                 Enzyme
NAME        nucleoside oxidase (H2O2-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     nucleoside:oxygen 5'-oxidoreductase (H2O2-forming)
REACTION    adenosine + 2 O2 + H2O = 9-riburonosyladenine + 2 H2O2 (overall reaction) [RN:R05695];
            (1a) adenosine + O2 = 5'-dehydroadenosine + H2O2 [RN:R05696];
            (1b) 5'-dehydroadenosine + O2 + H2O = 9-riburonosyladenine + H2O2 [RN:R05697]
ALL_REAC    R05695 R05696 R05697
SUBSTRATE   adenosine [CPD:C00212];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            5'-dehydroadenosine [CPD:C11500]
PRODUCT     9-riburonosyladenine [CPD:C11501];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027];
            5'-dehydroadenosine [CPD:C11500]
COMMENT     A heme-containing flavoprotein (FAD). Other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (as well as 2'-deoxynucleosides and arabinosides) are substrates, but ribose and nucleotides are not substrates. The overall reaction takes place in two separate steps, with the 5'-dehydro nucleoside being released from the enzyme to serve as substrate for the second reaction. This enzyme differs from EC 1.1.3.28, nucleoside oxidase, as it produces hydrogen peroxide rather than water.
