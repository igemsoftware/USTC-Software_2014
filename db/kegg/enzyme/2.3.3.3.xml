ENTRY       EC 2.3.3.3                  Enzyme
NAME        citrate (Re)-synthase;
            (R)-citrate synthase;
            Re-citrate-synthase;
            citrate oxaloacetate-lyase [(pro-3R)-CH2COO-->acetyl-CoA]
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Acyl groups converted into alkyl groups on transfer
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-acetyltransferase [thioester-hydrolysing, (pro-R)-carboxymethyl-forming]
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + H2O + oxaloacetate = citrate + CoA [RN:R00351]
ALL_REAC    R00351
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036]
PRODUCT     citrate [CPD:C00158];
            CoA [CPD:C00010]
COMMENT     This enzyme is inactivated by oxygen and is found in some anaerobes. Its stereospecificity is opposite to that of EC 2.3.3.1, citrate (Si)-synthase.
HISTORY     EC 2.3.3.3 created 1972 as EC 4.1.3.28, transferred 2002 to EC 2.3.3.3
