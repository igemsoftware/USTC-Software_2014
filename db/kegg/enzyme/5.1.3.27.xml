SYSNAME     dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose 3-epimerase
REACTION    dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose = dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-gulose [RN:R06437]
ALL_REAC    R06437
SUBSTRATE   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose [CPD:C11907]
PRODUCT     dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-gulose [CPD:C11926]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of dTDP-6-deoxy-alpha-D-allose, which is converted to mycinose after attachment to the aglycones of several macrolide antibiotics, including tylosin, chalcomycin, dihydrochalcomycin, and mycinamicin II.
