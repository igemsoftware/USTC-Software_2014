ENTRY       EC 1.1.3.23                 Enzyme
NAME        thiamine oxidase;
            thiamin dehydrogenase;
            thiamine dehydrogenase;
            thiamin:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With oxygen as acceptor
SYSNAME     thiamine:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase
REACTION    thiamine + 2 O2 + H2O = thiamine acetic acid + 2 H2O2 [RN:R02132]
ALL_REAC    R02132;
            (other) R00033 R00072
SUBSTRATE   thiamine [CPD:C00378];
            O2 [CPD:C00007];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     thiamine acetic acid [CPD:C02892];
            H2O2 [CPD:C00027]
COMMENT     A flavoprotein (FAD). The product differs from thiamine in replacement of -CH2.CH2.OH by -CH2.COOH; the two-step oxidation proceeds without the release of the intermediate aldehyde from the enzyme.
