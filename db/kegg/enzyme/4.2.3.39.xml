NAME        epi-cedrol synthase;
            8-epicedrol synthase;
            epicedrol synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (8-epi-cedrol-forming)
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + H2O = 8-epi-cedrol + diphosphate [RN:R09140]
ALL_REAC    R09140
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     8-epi-cedrol [CPD:C18245];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme is activated by Mg2+ [2]. Similar to many other plant terpenoid synthases, this enzyme produces many products from a single substrate. The predominant product is the cyclic sesquiterpenoid alcohol, 8-epi-cedrol, with minor products including cedrol and the olefins alpha-cedrene, beta-cedrene, (E)-beta-farnesene and (E)-alpha-bisabolene [1].
