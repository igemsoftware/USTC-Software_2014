COMMENT     3,7-Dimethylquercetagetin can also act as acceptor. Involved with EC 2.1.1.76 quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase and EC 2.1.1.82 3-methylquercetin 7-O-methyltransferase in the methylation of quercetin to 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetin in Chrysosplenium americanum. Does not act on flavones, dihydroflavonols, or their glucosides.
