SYSNAME     L-tyrosine ammonia-lyase (trans-p-hydroxycinnamate-forming)
REACTION    L-tyrosine = trans-p-hydroxycinnamate + NH3 [RN:R00737]
ALL_REAC    R00737;
            (other) R06132
SUBSTRATE   L-tyrosine [CPD:C00082]

COMMENT     This enzyme is a member of the aromatic amino acid lyase family, other members of which are EC 4.3.1.3 (histidine ammonia-lyase), EC 4.3.1.24 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and EC 4.3.1.25 (phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase). The enzyme contains the cofactor 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO), which is common to this family [1]. This unique cofactor is formed autocatalytically by cyclization and dehydration of the three amino-acid residues alanine, serine and glycine [3]. The enzyme is far more active with tyrosine than with phenylalanine as substrate, but the substrate specificity can be switched by mutation of a single amino acid (H89F) in the enzyme from the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides [1,2].
