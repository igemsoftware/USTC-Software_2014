ENTRY       EC 4.1.1.78                 Enzyme
NAME        acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase;
            acetylenedicarboxylate hydratase;
            acetylenedicarboxylate hydrase;
            acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-carbon lyases;
            Carboxy-lyases
SYSNAME     acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase (pyruvate-forming)
REACTION    acetylenedicarboxylate + H2O = pyruvate + CO2 [RN:R00218]
ALL_REAC    R00218;
            (other) R04177
SUBSTRATE   acetylenedicarboxylate [CPD:C03248];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     pyruvate [CPD:C00022];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     The mechanism appears to involve hydration of the acetylene and decarboxylation of the oxaloacetic acid formed, although free oxaloacetate is not an intermediate. It is thus analogous to EC 4.2.1.27 (acetylenecarboxylate hydratase) in its mechanism.
HISTORY     EC 4.1.1.78 created 1978 as EC 4.2.1.72, transferred 2000 to EC 4.1.1.78
