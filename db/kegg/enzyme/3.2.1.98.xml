ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.98                 Enzyme
NAME        glucan 1,4-alpha-maltohexaosidase;
            exo-maltohexaohydrolase;
            1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltohexaohydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     4-alpha-D-glucan maltohexaohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in amylaceous polysaccharides, to remove successive maltohexaose residues from the non-reducing chain ends
COMMENT     cf. EC 3.2.1.3 glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase, which removes successive glucose residues; EC 3.2.1.2 beta-amylase, which removes successive maltose residues; EC 3.2.1.116 glucan 1,4-alpha-maltotriohydrolase, which removes successive maltotriose units and EC 3.2.1.60 glucan 1,4-alpha-maltotetraohydrolase, which removes successive maltotetraose residues. The products have the alpha-configuration.
