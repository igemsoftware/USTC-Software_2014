NAME        lithocholate 6beta-hydroxylase;
            lithocholate 6beta-monooxygenase;
            CYP3A10;
            6beta-hydroxylase;
            cytochrome P450 3A10/lithocholic acid 6beta-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     lithocholate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6beta-hydroxylating)
REACTION    lithocholate + NADPH + H+ + O2 = 6beta-hydroxylithocholate + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R07203]
ALL_REAC    R07203
SUBSTRATE   lithocholate [CPD:C03990];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     6beta-hydroxylithocholate [CPD:C15515];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). Expression of the gene for this enzyme is 50-fold higher in male compared to female hamsters [1].
