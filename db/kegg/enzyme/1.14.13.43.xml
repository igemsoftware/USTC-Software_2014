ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.43               Enzyme
NAME        questin monooxygenase;
            questin oxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     questin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating, anthraquinone-ring-opening)
REACTION    questin + NADPH + H+ + O2 = demethylsulochrin + NADP+ [RN:R02417]
ALL_REAC    R02417
SUBSTRATE   questin [CPD:C01448];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     demethylsulochrin [CPD:C15504];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
COMMENT     The enzyme cleaves the anthraquinone ring of questin to form a benzophenone. Involved in the biosynthesis of the seco-anthraquinone (+)-geodin.
