ENTRY       EC 2.7.4.12                 Enzyme
NAME        T2-induced deoxynucleotide kinase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
SYSNAME     ATP:(d)NMP phosphotransferase
REACTION    ATP + dGMP (or dTMP) = ADP + dGDP (or dTDP) [RN:R02090 R02094]
ALL_REAC    R02090 R02094;
            (other) R00140
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            dGMP [CPD:C00362];
            dTMP [CPD:C00364]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
