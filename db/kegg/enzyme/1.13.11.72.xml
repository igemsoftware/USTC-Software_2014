NAME        2-hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase;
            HEPD;
            phpD (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases);
            With incorporation of two atoms of oxygen
SYSNAME     2-hydroxyethylphosphonate:O2 1,2-oxidoreductase (hydroxymethylphosphonate forming)
REACTION    2-hydroxyethylphosphonate + O2 = hydroxymethylphosphonate + formate [RN:R08864]
ALL_REAC    R08864
SUBSTRATE   2-hydroxyethylphosphonate [CPD:C06451];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     hydroxymethylphosphonate [CPD:C06455];
            formate [CPD:C00058]
COMMENT     Requires non-heme-Fe(II). Isolated from some bacteria including Streptomyces hygroscopicus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes. The pro-R hydrogen at C-2 of the ethyl group is retained by the formate ion. Any stereochemistry at C-1 of the ethyl group is lost. One atom from dioxygen is present in each product. Involved in phosphinothricin biosynthesis.
