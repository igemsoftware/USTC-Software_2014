NAME        [myosin-light-chain] phosphatase;
            myosin light chain kinase phosphatase;
            myosin phosphatase;
            myosin phosphatase;
            protein phosphatase 2A;
            myosin-light-chain-phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     [myosin-light-chain]-phosphate phosphohydrolase
REACTION    [myosin light-chain] phosphate + H2O = [myosin light-chain] + phosphate [RN:R03151]
ALL_REAC    R03151
SUBSTRATE   myosin light-chain phosphate [CPD:C03875];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     [myosin light-chain];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     The enzyme is composed of three subunits. The holoenzyme dephosphorylates myosin light chains and EC 2.7.11.18, myosin-light-chain kinase, but not myosin; the catalytic subunit acts on all three substrates.
