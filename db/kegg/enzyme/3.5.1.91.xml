ENTRY       EC 3.5.1.91                 Enzyme
NAME        N-substituted formamide deformylase;
            NfdA
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In linear amides
SYSNAME     N-benzylformamide amidohydrolase
REACTION    N-benzylformamide + H2O = formate + benzylamine [RN:R07303]
ALL_REAC    R07303
SUBSTRATE   N-benzylformamide [CPD:C15561];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     formate [CPD:C00058];
            benzylamine [CPD:C15562]
COMMENT     Zinc is a cofactor. While N-benzylformamide is the best substrate, the enzyme from Arthrobacter pascens can also act on the N-substituted formamides N-butylformamide, N-allylformamide, N-[2-(cyclohex-1-enyl)ethyl]formamide and N-(1-phenylethyl)formamide, but much more slowly. Amides of other acids do not act as substrates.
