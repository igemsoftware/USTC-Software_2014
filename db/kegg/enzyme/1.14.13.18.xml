            4-hydroxyphenylacetate 1-hydroxylase;
            4-hydroxyphenylacetic 1-hydroxylase;
            4-HPA 1-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-hydroxyphenylacetate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylating)
REACTION    4-hydroxyphenylacetate + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = homogentisate + NAD(P)+ + H2O [RN:R02514 R02516]
ALL_REAC    R02514 R02516
SUBSTRATE   4-hydroxyphenylacetate [CPD:C00642];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
