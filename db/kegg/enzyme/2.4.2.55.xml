SYSNAME     nicotinate D-ribonucleotide:phenol phospho-D-ribosyltransferase
REACTION    nicotinate D-ribonucleotide + phenol = nicotinate + phenyl 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribofuranoside [RN:R10608]
ALL_REAC    R10608
SUBSTRATE   nicotinate D-ribonucleotide [CPD:C01185];
            phenol [CPD:C00146]
PRODUCT     nicotinate [CPD:C00253];
            phenyl 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribofuranoside [CPD:C20726]
COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic cobamides in the Gram-positive bacterium Sporomusa ovata. It can also transfer the phospho-D-ribosyl group to 4-methylphenol and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. The related EC 2.4.2.21, nicotinate-nucleotide dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase, also transfers the phospho-D-ribosyl group from nicotinate D-ribonucleotide to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, but shows no activity with 4-methylphenol or phenol.
