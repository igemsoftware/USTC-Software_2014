SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:leachianone-G 2''-dimethylallyltransferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + leachianone G = diphosphate + sophoraflavanone G [RN:R08952]
ALL_REAC    R08952
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            leachianone G [CPD:C18024]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            sophoraflavanone G [CPD:C18053]
COMMENT     This membrane-bound enzyme is located in the plastids and requires Mg2+ for activity. The reaction forms the lavandulyl sidechain of sophoraflavanone G by transferring a dimethylallyl group to the 2'' position of another dimethylallyl group attached at postiion 8 of leachianone G. The enzyme is specific for dimethylallyl diphosphate as the prenyl donor, as it cannot be replaced by isopentenyl diphosphate or geranyl diphosphate. Euchrenone a7 (a 5-deoxy derivative of leachianone G) and kenusanone I (a 7-methoxy derivative of leachianone G) can also act as substrates, but more slowly. Along with EC 1.14.13.103 (8-dimethylallylnaringenin 2'-hydroxylase) and EC 2.5.1.70 (naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase), this enzyme forms part of the sophoraflavanone-G-biosynthesis pathway.
