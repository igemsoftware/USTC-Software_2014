            alpha-NAOS hydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     alpha-neoagaro-oligosaccharide 3-glycohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of the (1->3)-alpha-L-galactosidic linkages of neoagaro-oligosaccharides that are smaller than a hexamer, yielding 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and D-galactose
COMMENT     When neoagarohexaose is used as a substrate, the oligosaccharide is cleaved at the non-reducing end to produce 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and agaropentaose, which is further hydrolysed to agarobiose and agarotriose. With neoagarotetraose as substrate, the products are predominantly agarotriose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose. In Vibrio sp. the actions of EC 3.2.1.81, beta-agarase and EC 3.2.1.159 can be used to degrade agarose to 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and D-galactose.
