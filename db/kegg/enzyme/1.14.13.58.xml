ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.58               Enzyme
NAME        benzoyl-CoA 3-monooxygenase;
            benzoyl-CoA 3-hydroxylase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     benzoyl-CoA,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    benzoyl-CoA + NADPH + H+ + O2 = 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R02449]
ALL_REAC    R02449
SUBSTRATE   benzoyl-CoA [CPD:C00512];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA [CPD:C05195];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas KB740 catalyses a flavin-requiring reaction (FAD or FMN). Benzoate is not a substrate.
