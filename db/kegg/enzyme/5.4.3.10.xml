ENTRY       EC 5.4.3.10                 Enzyme
NAME        phenylalanine aminomutase (L-beta-phenylalanine forming)
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Intramolecular transferases;
            Transferring amino groups
SYSNAME     L-phenylalanine 2,3-aminomutase [(R)-3-amino-3-phenylpropanoate forming]
REACTION    L-phenylalanine = L-beta-phenylalanine [RN:R10286]
ALL_REAC    R10286
SUBSTRATE   L-phenylalanine [CPD:C00079]
PRODUCT     L-beta-phenylalanine [CPD:C20487]
COMMENT     The enzyme contains the cofactor 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO). This unique cofactor is formed autocatalytically by cyclization and dehydration of the three amino-acid residues alanine, serine and glycine. cf. EC 5.4.3.11, phenylalanine aminomutase (D-beta-phenylalanine forming).
