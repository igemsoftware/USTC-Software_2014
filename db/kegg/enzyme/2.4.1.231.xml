ENTRY       EC 2.4.1.231                Enzyme
NAME        alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase (configuration-retaining);
            trehalose phosphorylase[ambiguous]
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     alpha,alpha-trehalose:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate = alpha-D-glucose + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [RN:R07265]
ALL_REAC    R07265
SUBSTRATE   alpha,alpha-trehalose [CPD:C01083];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     alpha-D-glucose [CPD:C00267];
            alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00103]
COMMENT     Unlike EC 2.4.1.64, alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase, this enzyme retains its anomeric configuration. Vanadate is a strong competitive inhibitor of this reversible reaction.
