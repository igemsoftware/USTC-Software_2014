ENTRY       EC 2.4.1.282                Enzyme
NAME        3-O-alpha-D-glucosyl-L-rhamnose phosphorylase;
            cphy1019 (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnopyranose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnopyranose + phosphate = L-rhamnopyranose + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate [RN:R10098]
ALL_REAC    R10098
SUBSTRATE   3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnopyranose [CPD:C20354];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     L-rhamnopyranose [CPD:C00507];
            beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00663]
COMMENT     The enzyme does not phosphorylate alpha,alpha-trehalose, kojibiose, nigerose, or maltose. In the reverse phosphorolysis reaction the enzyme is specific for L-rhamnose as acceptor and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate as donor.
