NAME        vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (warfarin-insensitive)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With a disulfide as acceptor
SYSNAME     3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone:oxidized-dithiothreitol oxidoreductase
REACTION    3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone + oxidized dithiothreitol = 2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone + 1,4-dithiothreitol [RN:R03512]
ALL_REAC    R03512;
            (other) R05830
SUBSTRATE   3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone [CPD:C02785];
            oxidized dithiothreitol [CPD:C01119]
PRODUCT     2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone [CPD:C05849];
            1,4-dithiothreitol [CPD:C00265]
COMMENT     In the reverse reaction, vitamin K 2,3-epoxide is reduced to 3-hydroxy- (and 2-hydroxy-) vitamin K by 1,4-dithiothreitol, which is oxidized to a disulfide. Not inhibited by warfarin [cf. EC 1.1.4.1 vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (warfarin-sensitive)].
