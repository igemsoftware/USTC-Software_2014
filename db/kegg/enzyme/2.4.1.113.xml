ENTRY       EC 2.4.1.113                Enzyme
NAME        alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase (ADP-forming);
            ADP-glucose:protein glucosyltransferase;
            adenosine diphosphoglucose-protein glucosyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     ADP-glucose:protein 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    ADP-glucose + protein = ADP + alpha-D-glucosyl-protein [RN:R02420]
ALL_REAC    R02420
SUBSTRATE   ADP-glucose [CPD:C00498];
            protein [CPD:C00017]
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            alpha-D-glucosyl-protein [CPD:C01140]
COMMENT     The enzyme builds up alpha-1,4-glucan chains covalently bound to protein, thus acting as an initiator of glycogen synthesis.
