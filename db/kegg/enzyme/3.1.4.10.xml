ENTRY       EC 3.1.4.10       Obsolete  Enzyme
NAME        Transferred to 4.6.1.13
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-diester hydrolases
COMMENT     Transferred entry: 1-phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase. Now EC 4.6.1.13, phosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase. As there is no hydrolysis of the inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate formed, previous classification of the enzyme as a hydrolase was incorrect
HISTORY     EC 3.1.4.10 created 1972, modified 1976, deleted 2002
