SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:N,N-dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (betaine-forming)
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + N,N-dimethylglycine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + betaine [RN:R07244]
ALL_REAC    R07244
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            N,N-dimethylglycine [CPD:C01026]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            betaine [CPD:C00719]
COMMENT     This enzyme, from the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH8102, differs from EC 2.1.1.157, sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase in that it cannot use sarcosine as an alternative substrate [1]. Betaine is a 'compatible solute' that enables cyanobacteria to cope with osmotic stress by maintaining a positive cellular turgor.
