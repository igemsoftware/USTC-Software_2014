ENTRY       EC 1.14.11.32               Enzyme
NAME        codeine 3-O-demethylase;
            codeine O-demethylase;
            CODM
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor
SYSNAME     codeine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-O-demethylating)
REACTION    codeine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = morphine + formaldehyde + succinate + CO2 [RN:R09402]
ALL_REAC    R09402;
            (other) R05127
SUBSTRATE   codeine [CPD:C06174];
            2-oxoglutarate [CPD:C00026];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     morphine [CPD:C01516];
            formaldehyde [CPD:C00067];
            succinate [CPD:C00042];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011]
COMMENT     Requires Fe2+. Catalyses a step in morphine biosynthesis. The enzyme also catalyses the 3-O-demethylation of thebaine to oripavine, with lower efficiency.
