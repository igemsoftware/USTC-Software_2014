ENTRY       EC 3.2.2.25                 Enzyme
NAME        N-methyl nucleosidase;
            7-methylxanthosine nucleosidase;
            N-MeNase;
            N-methyl nucleoside hydrolase;
            methylpurine nucleosidase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Hydrolysing N-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     7-methylxanthosine ribohydrolase
REACTION    7-methylxanthosine + H2O = 7-methylxanthine + D-ribose [RN:R07918]
ALL_REAC    R07918
SUBSTRATE   7-methylxanthosine [CPD:C16352];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     7-methylxanthine [CPD:C16353];
            D-ribose [CPD:C00121]
COMMENT     The enzyme preferentially hydrolyses 3- and 7-methylpurine nucleosides, such as 3-methylxanthosine, 3-methyladenosine and 7-methylguanosine. Hydrolysis of 7-methylxanthosine to form 7-methylxanthine is the second step in the caffeine-biosynthesis pathway.
