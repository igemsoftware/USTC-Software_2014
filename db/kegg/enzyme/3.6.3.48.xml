ENTRY       EC 3.6.3.48                 Enzyme
NAME        alpha-factor-transporting ATPase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on acid anhydrides;
            Acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances
SYSNAME     ATP phosphohydrolase (alpha-factor-transporting)
REACTION    ATP + H2O + alpha-factorin = ADP + phosphate + alpha-factorout [RN:R00086]
ALL_REAC    R00086
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            alpha-factor
PRODUCT     ADP [CPD:C00008];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            alpha-factor
COMMENT     ABC-type (ATP-binding cassette-type) ATPase, characterized by the presence of two similar ATP-binding domains. Does not undergo phosphorylation during the transport process. A yeast enzyme that exports the alpha-factor sex pheromone.
