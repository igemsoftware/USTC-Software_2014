SYSNAME     threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming)
REACTION    threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate = oxaloacetate + NH3 [RN:R05758]
ALL_REAC    R05758
SUBSTRATE   threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate [CPD:C11511]
PRODUCT     oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The enzyme, purified from the bacterium Pseudomonas sp. T62, is highly specific, and does not accept any other stereoisomer of 3-hydroxyaspartate. Different from EC 4.3.1.20, erythro-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase and EC 4.3.1.27, threo-3-hydroxy-D-aspartate ammonia-lyase. Requires a divalent cation such as Mn2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+.
