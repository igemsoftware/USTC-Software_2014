ENTRY       EC 2.3.1.152                Enzyme
NAME        alcohol O-cinnamoyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose:alcohol O-cinnamoyltransferase
REACTION    1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose + ROH = alkyl cinnamate + glucose [RN:R04411]
ALL_REAC    R04411 > R04409 R04410 R05061
SUBSTRATE   1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose [CPD:C04164];
            ROH [CPD:C01335]
PRODUCT     alkyl cinnamate [CPD:C06357];
            glucose [CPD:C00031]
COMMENT     Acceptor alcohols (ROH) include methanol, ethanol and propanol. No cofactors are required as 1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose itself is an "energy-rich" (activated) acyl-donor, comparable to CoA-thioesters. 1-O-trans-Cinnamoyl-beta-D-gentobiose can also act as the acyl donor, but with much less affinity.
