ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.45                 Enzyme
NAME        homospermidine synthase (spermidine-specific)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     spermidine:putrescine 4-aminobutyltransferase (propane-1,3-diamine-forming)
REACTION    spermidine + putrescine = sym-homospermidine + propane-1,3-diamine [RN:R01919]
ALL_REAC    R01919
SUBSTRATE   spermidine [CPD:C00315];
            putrescine [CPD:C00134]
PRODUCT     sym-homospermidine [CPD:C06366];
            propane-1,3-diamine [CPD:C00986]
COMMENT     The reaction of this enzyme occurs in three steps, with some of the intermediates presumably remaining enzyme-bound: (a) NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of spermidine, (b) transfer of the 4-aminobutylidene group from dehydrospermidine to putrescine and (c) reduction of the imine intermediate to form homospermidine. This enzyme is more specific than EC 2.5.1.44, homospermidine synthase, which is found in bacteria, as it cannot use putrescine as donor of the 4-aminobutyl group. Forms part of the biosynthetic pathway of the poisonous pyrrolizidine alkaloids of the ragworts (Senecio).
