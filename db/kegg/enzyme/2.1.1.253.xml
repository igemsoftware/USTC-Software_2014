            methyltransferase 2 (ambiguous);
            mtqA (gene name)
CLASS       Transferases;

SYSNAME     methylated tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase
REACTION    a [methyl-Co(III) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] + coenzyme M = methyl-CoM + a [Co(I) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] [RN:R10000]
ALL_REAC    R10000
SUBSTRATE   [methyl-Co(III) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein];
            coenzyme M [CPD:C19637]
PRODUCT     methyl-CoM [CPD:C03920];
            [Co(I) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein]
COMMENT     The enzyme, which is involved in methanogenesis from tetramethylammonium, catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from a corrinoid protein (see EC 2.1.1.252, tetramethylammonium---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase), where it is bound to the cobalt cofactor, to coenzyme M, forming the substrate for EC 2.8.4.1, coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase, the enzyme that catalyses the final step in methanogenesis.
