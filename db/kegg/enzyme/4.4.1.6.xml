            Carbon-sulfur lyases (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     S-alkyl-L-cysteine alkyl-thiol-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming)
REACTION    an S-alkyl-L-cysteine + H2O = an alkyl thiol + NH3 + pyruvate [RN:R02953]
ALL_REAC    R02953
SUBSTRATE   S-alkyl-L-cysteine [CPD:C02749];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     alkyl thiol [CPD:C00812];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014];
            pyruvate [CPD:C00022]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. Decomposes S-alkyl-L-cysteines by alpha,beta-elimination. Possibly identical, in yeast, with EC 4.4.1.8 cystathionine beta-lyase.
