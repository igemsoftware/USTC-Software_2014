SYSNAME     GDP-mannose:D-fructose-6-phosphate 2-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase
REACTION    GDP-mannose + D-fructose 6-phosphate = GDP + beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside 6F-phosphate [RN:R08947]
ALL_REAC    R08947
SUBSTRATE   GDP-mannose [CPD:C00096];
            D-fructose 6-phosphate [CPD:C00085]
PRODUCT     GDP [CPD:C00035];
            beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside 6F-phosphate [CPD:C18050]
COMMENT     This enzyme, from the soil proteobacterium and plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. GDP-mannose can be replaced by ADP-mannose but with a concomitant decrease in activity. The product of this reaction is dephosphorylated by EC 3.1.3.79 (mannosylfructose-phosphate phosphatase) to form the non-reducing disaccharide mannosylfructose, which is the major endogenous osmolyte produced by several alpha-proteobacteria in response to osmotic stress. The F in the product name is used to indicate that the fructose residue of sucrose carries the substituent.
