NAME        dimethylmalate dehydrogenase;
            beta,beta-dimethylmalate dehydrogenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating)
REACTION    (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate + NAD+ = 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + CO2 + NADH [RN:R01211]
ALL_REAC    R01211
SUBSTRATE   (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate [CPD:C01088];
