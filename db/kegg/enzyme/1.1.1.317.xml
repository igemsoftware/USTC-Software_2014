ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.317                Enzyme
NAME        perakine reductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     raucaffrinoline:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    raucaffrinoline + NADP+ = perakine + NADPH + H+ [RN:R09806]
ALL_REAC    R09806
SUBSTRATE   raucaffrinoline [CPD:C19931];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     perakine [CPD:C19932];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The biosynthesis of raucaffrinoline from perakine is a side route of the ajmaline biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme is a member of the aldo-keto reductase enzyme superfamily from higher plants.
