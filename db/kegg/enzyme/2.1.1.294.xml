COMMENT     The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the polymannose O-polysaccharide in the outer leaflet of the membrane of Escherichia coli serotype O9a. O-Polysaccharide structures vary extensively because of differences in the number and type of sugars in the repeat unit. The dual kinase/methylase WbdD also catalyses the preceding phosphorylation of alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)]n-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-GlcNAc-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol (cf. EC 2.7.1.181, alpha-D-Man-(1->2)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-alpha-D-Man-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol 3-kinase).
