COMMENT     The enzyme was characterized from the dental caries bacterium Streptococcus mutans. It transfers glucosyl residues from sucrose to either the 6- or the 3-positions of glucose residues in glucans, producing a highly-branched extracellular D-glucan polymers that promote attachment of the bacteria to teeth. Three types of the enzyme have been described; the insoluble polymers produced by GTF-I and GTF-SI contain 85% alpha(1->3) bonds and 15% alpha(1->6) bonds, while the soluble polymers produced by GTF-S contain only 30% of alpha(1->3) bonds and 70% alpha(1->6) bonds. cf. EC 2.4.1.5, dextransucrase [5].
