NAME        sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase;
            uridine diphosphoglucose-sinapate glucosyltransferase;
            UDP-glucose:sinapic acid glucosyltransferase;
            uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose-hydroxycinnamic acid acylglucosyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Glycosyltransferases;
            Hexosyltransferases
SYSNAME     UDP-glucose:sinapate D-glucosyltransferase
REACTION    UDP-glucose + sinapate = UDP + 1-sinapoyl-D-glucose [RN:R02380]
ALL_REAC    R02380;
            (other) R08839
SUBSTRATE   UDP-glucose [CPD:C00029];
            sinapate [CPD:C00482]
PRODUCT     UDP [CPD:C00015];
            1-sinapoyl-D-glucose
COMMENT     Some other hydroxycinnamates, including 4-coumarate, ferulate and caffeate, can act as acceptors, but more slowly. Only glucose esters, not glucosides, are formed (cf. EC 2.4.1.126 hydroxycinnamate 4-beta-glucosyltransferase).
