ENTRY       EC 2.5.1.88                 Enzyme
NAME        trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase [(2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate specific]
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups;
            Transferring alkyl or aryl groups, other than methyl groups (only sub-subclass identified to date)
SYSNAME     (2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate cistransferase (adding 9--11 isopentenyl units)
REACTION    (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + n isopentenyl diphosphate = n diphosphate + trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate (n = 9--11) [RN:R09731]
ALL_REAC    R09731
SUBSTRATE   (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C16826];
            isopentenyl diphosphate [CPD:C00129]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate [CPD:C19853]
COMMENT     Highest activity with (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate as allylic substrate. Broad product specificity with the major product being dodecaprenyl diphosphate. Synthesizes even C70 prenyl diphosphate as the maximum chain-length product [1].
