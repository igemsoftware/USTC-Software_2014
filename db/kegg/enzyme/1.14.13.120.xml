ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.120              Enzyme
NAME        costunolide synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6alpha-hydroxylating)
REACTION    germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (+)-costunolide + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R09575]
ALL_REAC    R09575
SUBSTRATE   germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate [CPD:C19678];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (+)-costunolide [CPD:C09382];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). The enzyme hydroxylates carbon C-6 of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate to give 6alpha-hydroxygermacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate, which probably spontaneously cyclises to form the lactone ring.
