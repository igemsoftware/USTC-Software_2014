            sugar nucleotide phosphorylase;
            NDP:aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Nucleotidyltransferases
SYSNAME     NDP:alpha-D-aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase
REACTION    NDP + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate = phosphate + NDP-aldose [RN:R03143]
ALL_REAC    R03143
SUBSTRATE   NDP [CPD:C00454];
            alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00991]
PRODUCT     phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            NDP-aldose [CPD:C01599]
COMMENT     The enzyme works on a variety of alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphates and beta-L-aldose 1-phosphates (which have the same anomeric configuration as the former; see 2-Carb-6.2).
