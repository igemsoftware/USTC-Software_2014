REACTION    geranyl diphosphate = (R)-limonene + diphosphate [RN:R06120]
ALL_REAC    R06120
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341]
PRODUCT     (R)-limonene;
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     Forms the first step of carvone biosynthesis in caraway. The enzyme from Carum carvi (caraway) seeds requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mn2+) for catalysis. This enzyme occurs in Citrus, Carum (caraway) and Anethum (dill); (-)-limonene, however, is made in the fir, Abies, and mint, Mentha, by EC 4.2.3.16, (4S)-limonene synthase.
