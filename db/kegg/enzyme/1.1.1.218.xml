ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.218                Enzyme
NAME        morphine 6-dehydrogenase;
            naloxone reductase;
            reductase, naloxone
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     morphine:NAD(P)+ 6-oxidoreductase
REACTION    morphine + NAD(P)+ = morphinone + NAD(P)H + H+ [RN:R03591 R03592]
ALL_REAC    R03591 R03592
SUBSTRATE   morphine [CPD:C01516];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     morphinone [CPD:C01735];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Also acts on some other alkaloids, including codeine, normorphine and ethylmorphine, but only very slowly on 7,8-saturated derivatives such as dihydromorphine and dihydrocodeine. In the reverse direction, also reduces naloxone to the 6alpha-hydroxy analogue. Activated by 2-mercaptoethanol.
