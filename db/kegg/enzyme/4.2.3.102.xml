NAME        sesquithujene synthase;
            TPS5-Del1
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (sesquithujene-forming)
REACTION    (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate = sesquithujene + diphosphate [RN:R09902]
ALL_REAC    R09902
SUBSTRATE   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate [CPD:C00448]
PRODUCT     sesquithujene [CPD:C20178];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme from Zea mays, variety Delprim, gives mainly sesquithujene with (S)-beta-bisabolene and (E)-beta-farnesene plus traces of other sesquiterpenoids, cf. EC 4.2.3.55 [(S)-beta-bisabolene synthase] and EC 4.2.3.47 (beta-farnesene synthase). It requires Mg2+ or Mn2+. The exact product ratio is dependent on which metal ion is present.
