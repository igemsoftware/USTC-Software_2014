NAME        alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase;
            FAR (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     long-chain acyl-CoA:NADPH reductase
REACTION    a long-chain acyl-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ = a long-chain alcohol + 2 NADP+ + coenzyme A [RN:R10104]
ALL_REAC    R10104
SUBSTRATE   long-chain acyl-CoA [CPD:C02843];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     long-chain alcohol [CPD:C00339];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            coenzyme A [CPD:C00010]
COMMENT     The enzyme has been characterized from the plant Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba). The alcohol is formed by a four-electron reduction of fatty acyl-CoA. Although the reaction proceeds through an aldehyde intermediate, a free aldehyde is not released. The recombinant enzyme was shown to accept saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs of 16 to 22 carbons.
