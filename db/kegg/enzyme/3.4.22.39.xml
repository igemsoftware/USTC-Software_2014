ENTRY       EC 3.4.22.39                Enzyme
NAME        adenain
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Cysteine endopeptidases
REACTION    Cleaves proteins of the adenovirus and its host cell at two consensus sites: -Yaa-Xaa-Gly-Gly!Xaa- and -Yaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa!Gly- (in which Yaa is Met, Ile or Leu, and Xaa is any amino acid)
COMMENT     A cysteine endopeptidase from adenoviruses, the type example of peptidase family C5, with a protein fold unlike that known for any other peptidase [2]. Activity is greatly stimulated by the binding to the enzyme of an 11-residue peptide from the adenovirus capsid protein pre-VI at a site separate from the active site [1]
