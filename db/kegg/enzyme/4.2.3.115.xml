ENTRY       EC 4.2.3.115                Enzyme
NAME        alpha-terpinene synthase
CLASS       Lyases;
            Carbon-oxygen lyases;
            Acting on phosphates
SYSNAME     geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, alpha-terpinene-forming)
REACTION    geranyl diphosphate = alpha-terpinene + diphosphate [RN:R09970]
ALL_REAC    R09970
SUBSTRATE   geranyl diphosphate [CPD:C00341]
PRODUCT     alpha-terpinene [CPD:C09898];
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme has been characterized from Dysphania ambrosioides (American wormseed). Requires Mg2+. Mn2+ is less effective. The enzyme will also use (3R)-linalyl diphosphate. The reaction involves a 1,2-hydride shift. The 1-pro-S hydrogen of geranyl diphosphate is lost.
