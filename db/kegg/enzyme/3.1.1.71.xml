NAME        acetylalkylglycerol acetylhydrolase;
            alkylacetylglycerol acetylhydrolase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Carboxylic-ester hydrolases
SYSNAME     2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol acetylhydrolase
REACTION    2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol + H2O = 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol + acetate [RN:R04043]
ALL_REAC    R04043
SUBSTRATE   2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol [CPD:C03820];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     1-alkyl-sn-glycerol [CPD:C02773];
            acetate [CPD:C00033]
COMMENT     Hydrolysis of the acetyl group from the 1-alkyl-2-acetyl and 1-alkyl-3-acetyl substrates occurs at apparently identical rates. The enzyme from Erlich ascites cells is membrane-bound. It differs from lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) since 1,2-diacetyl-sn-glycerols are not substrates. It also differs from EC 3.1.1.47, 1-acetyl-2-alkyl-glycerophosphocholine esterase.
