SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(+/-)-pavine N-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (+/-)-pavine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylpavine [RN:R10680]
ALL_REAC    R10680
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            (+/-)-pavine [CPD:C20771]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            N-methylpavine [CPD:C20770]
COMMENT     The enzyme, isolated from the plant Thalictrum flavum, also methylates (R,S)-stylopine and (S)-scoulerine (11%) with lower activity (14% and 11%, respectively).
