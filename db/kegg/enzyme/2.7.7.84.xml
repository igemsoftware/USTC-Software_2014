ENTRY       EC 2.7.7.84                 Enzyme
NAME        2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase;
            OAS
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Nucleotidyltransferases
SYSNAME     ATP:ATP adenylyltransferase (2'-5' linkages-forming)
REACTION    3 ATP = pppA2'p5'A2'p5'A + 2 diphosphate
SUBSTRATE   ATP [CPD:C00002]
PRODUCT     pppA2'p5'A2'p5'A;
            diphosphate [CPD:C00013]
COMMENT     The enzyme is activated by binding to double-stranded RNA. The resulting product binds to and activates RNase L, which subsequently degrades the RNA. Oligoadenylates of chain lengths 2, 4 and 5 are also produced. The dimer does not have any known biological activity [2].
