NAME        2,3-bisphosphoglycerate 3-phosphatase;
            MIPP1;
            2,3-BPG 3-phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate 3-phosphohydrolase
REACTION    2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate + H2O = 2-phospho-D-glycerate + phosphate [RN:R09532]
ALL_REAC    R09532
SUBSTRATE   2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate [CPD:C01159];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     2-phospho-D-glycerate [CPD:C00631];
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
COMMENT     This reaction is a shortcut in the Rapoport-Luebering shunt. It bypasses the reactions of EC 3.1.3.13/EC 5.4.2.12 [bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase/phosphoglycerate mutase (2,3-diphosphoglycerate-independent)] and directly forms 2-phospho-D-glycerate by removing the 3-phospho-group of 2,3-diphospho-D-glycerate [1]. The MIPP1 protein also catalyses the reaction of EC 3.1.3.62 (multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase).
