ENTRY       EC 2.8.3.14                 Enzyme
NAME        5-hydroxypentanoate CoA-transferase;
            5-hydroxyvalerate CoA-transferase;
            5-hydroxyvalerate coenzyme A transferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            CoA-transferases
SYSNAME     acetyl-CoA:5-hydroxypentanoate CoA-transferase
REACTION    acetyl-CoA + 5-hydroxypentanoate = acetate + 5-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA [RN:R04057]
ALL_REAC    R04057
SUBSTRATE   acetyl-CoA [CPD:C00024];
            5-hydroxypentanoate [CPD:C02804]
PRODUCT     acetate [CPD:C00033];
            5-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA [CPD:C03237]
COMMENT     Propanoyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, butanoyl-CoA and some other acyl-CoAs can act as substrates, but more slowly than 5-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA.
