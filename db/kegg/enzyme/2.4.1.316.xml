SYSNAME     dTDP-alpha-D-mycaminose:tylactone 5-O-beta-D-mycaminosyltransferase
REACTION    tylactone + dTDP-alpha-D-mycaminose = dTDP + 5-O-beta-D-mycaminosyltylactone [RN:R06450]
ALL_REAC    R06450
SUBSTRATE   tylactone [CPD:C12000];
            dTDP-alpha-D-mycaminose [CPD:C11933]
PRODUCT     dTDP [CPD:C00363];
            5-O-beta-D-mycaminosyltylactone [CPD:C12001]
COMMENT     The enzyme participates in the biosynthetic pathway of the macrolide antibiotic tylosin, which is produced by several species of Streptomyces bacteria. Activity is significantly enhanced by the presence of an accessory protein encoded by the tylM3 gene.
