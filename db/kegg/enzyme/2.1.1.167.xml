SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:27S pre-rRNA (guanosine2922-2'-O-)-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanosine2922 in 27S pre-rRNA = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylguanosine2922 in 27S pre-rRNA
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            guanosine2922 in 27S pre-rRNA
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            2'-O-methylguanosine2922 in 27S pre-rRNA
COMMENT     Spb1p is a site-specific 2'-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase that catalyses the formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine2922, a universally conserved position of the catalytic center of the ribosome that is essential for translation. 2'-O-Methylguanosine2922 is formed at a later stage of the processing, during the maturation of of the 27S pre-rRNA. In absence of snR52, Spb1p can also catalyse the formation of uridine2921 [1].
