SYSNAME     threo-3-hydroxy-D-aspartate ammonia-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming)
REACTION    threo-3-hydroxy-D-aspartate = oxaloacetate + NH3 [RN:R09683]
ALL_REAC    R09683
SUBSTRATE   threo-3-hydroxy-D-aspartate [CPD:C19813]
PRODUCT     oxaloacetate [CPD:C00036];
            NH3 [CPD:C00014]
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The enzyme, purified from the bacterium Delftia sp. HT23, also has activity against L-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, L-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate, and D-serine. Different from EC 4.3.1.20, erythro-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase and EC 4.3.1.16, threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase. Requires a divalent cation such as Mn2+, Co2+ or Ni2+.
