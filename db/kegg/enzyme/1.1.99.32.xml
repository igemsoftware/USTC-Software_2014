NAME        L-sorbose 1-dehydrogenase;
            SDH
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With other acceptors
SYSNAME     L-sorbose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase
REACTION    L-sorbose + acceptor = 1-dehydro-L-sorbose + reduced acceptor [RN:R09551]
ALL_REAC    R09551
SUBSTRATE   L-sorbose [CPD:C00247];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     1-dehydro-L-sorbose [CPD:C19679];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     The product, L-sorbosone, is an intermediate in bacterial 2-keto-L-gulonic-acid formation. The activity of this membrane-bound enzyme is stimulated by Fe(III) or Co2+ but is inhibited by Cu2+. The enzyme is highly specific for L-sorbose as other sugars, such as glucose, mannitol and sorbitol, are not substrates. Phenazine methosulfate and DCIP can act as artificial acceptors.
