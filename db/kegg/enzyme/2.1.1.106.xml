NAME        tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase;
            tryptophan 2-methyltransferase;
            S-adenosylmethionine:tryptophan 2-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + L-tryptophan = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + L-2-methyltryptophan [RN:R08547]
ALL_REAC    R08547
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            L-tryptophan [CPD:C00078]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            L-2-methyltryptophan [CPD:C16831]
COMMENT     D-Tryptophan and (indol-3-yl)pyruvate can also act as acceptors, but more slowly.
