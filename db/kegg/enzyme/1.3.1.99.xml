ENTRY       EC 1.3.1.99                 Enzyme
NAME        iridoid synthase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     8-oxogeranial:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (cyclizing, cis-trans-nepetalactol forming)
REACTION    (6E)-8-oxogeranial + NAD(P)H + H+ = cis-trans-nepetalactol + NAD(P)+
SUBSTRATE   (6E)-8-oxogeranial [CPD:C17622];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
PRODUCT     cis-trans-nepetalactol [CPD:C09804];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
COMMENT     Isolated from the plant Catharanthus roseus. The reaction may involve cyclization via a Diels-Alder or Michael reaction. Iridoids are involved in the biosynthesis of many indole alkaloids. The cyclic hemiacetal is readily hydrolysed to the corresponding dial.
