ENTRY       EC 3.1.3.91                 Enzyme
NAME        7-methylguanosine nucleotidase;
            cytosolic nucleotidase III-like;
            cNIII-like;
            N7-methylguanylate 5'-phosphatase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Phosphoric-monoester hydrolases
SYSNAME     N7-methyl-GMP phosphohydrolase
REACTION    (1) N7-methyl-GMP + H2O = N7-methyl-guanosine + phosphate [RN:R10546];
            (2) CMP + H2O = cytidine + phosphate [RN:R00511]
ALL_REAC    R00511 R10546
SUBSTRATE   N7-methyl-GMP [CPD:C03998];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            CMP [CPD:C00055]
PRODUCT     N7-methyl-guanosine;
            phosphate [CPD:C00009];
            cytidine [CPD:C00475]
COMMENT     The enzyme also has low activity with N7-methyl-GDP, producing N7-methyl-GMP. Does not accept AMP or GMP, and has low activity with UMP.
