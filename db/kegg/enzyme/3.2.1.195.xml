ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.195                Enzyme
NAME        20-O-multi-glycoside ginsenosidase;
            ginsenosidase type II (erroneous)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside 20-beta-D-glucohydrolase
REACTION    a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with two glycosyl residues at position 20 + H2O = a protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with a single glucosyl residue at position 20 + a monosaccharide
SUBSTRATE   protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with two glycosyl residues at position 20;
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside with a single glucosyl residue at position 20;
            monosaccharide
COMMENT     The 20-O-multi-glycoside ginsenosidase catalyses the hydrolysis of the 20-O-alpha-(1->6)-glycosidic bond and the 20-O-beta-(1->6)-glycosidic bond of protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides. The enzyme usually leaves a single glucosyl residue attached at position 20, although it can cleave the remaining glucosyl residue with a lower efficiency. Starting with a ginsenoside that is glycosylated at positions 3 and 20, such as ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3 and Rc, the most common product is ginsenoside Rd, with a low amount of ginsenoside Rg3 also formed.
