NAME        3-hydroxyphenylacetate 6-hydroxylase;
            3-hydroxyphenylacetate 6-monooxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     3-hydroxyphenylacetate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-hydroxylating)
REACTION    3-hydroxyphenylacetate + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2 = 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate + NAD(P)+ + H2O [RN:R02515 R02517]
ALL_REAC    R02515 R02517
SUBSTRATE   3-hydroxyphenylacetate [CPD:C05593];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate [CPD:C00544];
