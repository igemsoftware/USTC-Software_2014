NAME        4-hydroxybenzoate 1-hydroxylase;
            4-hydroxybenzoate 1-monooxygenase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     4-hydroxybenzoate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylating, decarboxylating)
REACTION    4-hydroxybenzoate + NAD(P)H + 2 H+ + O2 = hydroquinone + NAD(P)+ + H2O + CO2 [RN:R01297 R01299]
ALL_REAC    R01297 R01299;
            (other) R01629 R01630
SUBSTRATE   4-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00156];
            NADH [CPD:C00004];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     hydroquinone [CPD:C00530];
            NAD+ [CPD:C00003];
