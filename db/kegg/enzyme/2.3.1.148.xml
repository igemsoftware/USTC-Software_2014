NAME        glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent)
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine acyltransferase (CoA-dependent)
REACTION    1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine = 1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [RN:R04721]
ALL_REAC    R04721
SUBSTRATE   1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [CPD:C05212];
            1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [CPD:C05209]
PRODUCT     1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [CPD:C04475];
            1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [CPD:C04317]
COMMENT     Catalyses the transfer of fatty acids from intact choline- or ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids to the sn-2 position of a lyso-glycerophospholipid. The organyl group on sn-1 of the donor or acceptor molecule can be alkyl, acyl or alk-1-enyl. The term 'radyl' has sometimes been used to refer to such substituting groups. Differs from EC 2.3.1.147 glycerophospholipid arachidonoyl-transferase (CoA-independent) in requiring CoA and not favouring the transfer of polyunsaturated acyl groups.
