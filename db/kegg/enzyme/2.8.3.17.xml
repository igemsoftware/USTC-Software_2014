NAME        cinnamoyl-CoA:phenyllactate CoA-transferase;
            FldA
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring sulfur-containing groups;
            CoA-transferases
SYSNAME     (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA:(R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase
REACTION    (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA + (R)-phenyllactate = (E)-cinnamate + (R)-phenyllactyl-CoA [RN:R07796]
ALL_REAC    R07796
SUBSTRATE   (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA [CPD:C16256];
            (R)-phenyllactate [CPD:C05607]
PRODUCT     (E)-cinnamate [CPD:C00423];
            (R)-phenyllactyl-CoA [CPD:C16257]
COMMENT     3-Phenylproprionate is a better CoA acceptor than (R)-phenyllactate in vitro. The enzyme from Clostridium sporogenes is specific for derivatives of 3-phenylpropionate and 4-phenylbutyrate.
