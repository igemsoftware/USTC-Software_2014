NAME        squalene methyltransferase;
            TMT-1;
            TMT-2
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:squalene C-methyltransferase
REACTION    2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + squalene = 2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,22-dimethyl-1,2,23,24-tetradehydro-2,3,22,23-tetrahydrosqualene (overall reaction) [RN:R10169];
            (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + squalene = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene [RN:R10167];
            (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,22-dimethyl-1,2,23,24-tetradehydro-2,3,22,23-tetrahydrosqualene [RN:R10168]
ALL_REAC    R10167 R10168 R10169
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            squalene [CPD:C00751];
            3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene [CPD:C20411]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            3,22-dimethyl-1,2,23,24-tetradehydro-2,3,22,23-tetrahydrosqualene [CPD:C20412];
            3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene [CPD:C20411]
COMMENT     Two isoforms differing in their specificity were isolated from the green alga Botryococcus braunii BOT22. TMT-1 gave more of the dimethylated form whereas TMT2 gave more of the monomethylated form.
