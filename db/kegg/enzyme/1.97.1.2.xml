            Sole sub-subclass for oxidoreductases that do not belong in the other subclasses
SYSNAME     1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene:1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene hydroxytransferase
REACTION    1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene + 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene = 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene [RN:R04297]
ALL_REAC    R04297
SUBSTRATE   1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene [CPD:C03743];
            1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene [CPD:C01108]
PRODUCT     1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene [CPD:C02183];
            1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene [CPD:C03743]
COMMENT     1,2,3,5-Tetrahydroxybenzene acts as a co-substrate for the conversion of pyrogallol into phloroglucinol, and for a number of similar isomerizations. The enzyme is provisionally listed here, but might be considered as the basis for a new class in the transferases, analogous to the aminotransferases.
