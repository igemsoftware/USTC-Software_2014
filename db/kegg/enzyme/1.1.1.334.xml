ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.334                Enzyme
NAME        methylecgonone reductase;
            MecgoR (gene name)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     ecgonine methyl ester:NADP+ oxidoreductase
REACTION    ecgonine methyl ester + NADP+ = ecgonone methyl ester + NADPH + H+ [RN:R10114]
ALL_REAC    R10114
SUBSTRATE   ecgonine methyl ester [CPD:C12448];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     ecgonone methyl ester [CPD:C20371];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the plant Erythroxylum coca catalyses the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of cocaine. In vivo the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction. With NADH instead of NADPH the reaction rate is reduced to 14%. The enzyme also reduces tropinone, nortropinone and 6-hydroxytropinone but with lower reaction rates.
