ENTRY       EC 1.2.7.11                 Enzyme
NAME        2-oxoacid oxidoreductase (ferredoxin);
            OFOR
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors;
            With an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor
SYSNAME     2-oxocarboxylate:ferredoxin 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating, CoA-acylating)
REACTION    a 2-oxocarboxylate + CoA + 2 oxidized ferredoxin = an acyl-CoA + CO2 + 2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H+ [RN:R10516]
ALL_REAC    R10516
SUBSTRATE   2-oxocarboxylate [CPD:C00161];
            CoA [CPD:C00010];
            oxidized ferredoxin [CPD:C00139]
PRODUCT     acyl-CoA [CPD:C00040];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            reduced ferredoxin [CPD:C00138];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     Contains thiamine diphosphate and [4Fe-4S] clusters [2]. This enzyme is a member of the 2-oxoacid oxidoreductases, a family of enzymes that oxidatively decarboxylate different 2-oxoacids to form their CoA derivatives, and are differentiated based on their substrate specificity. For example, see EC 1.2.7.3, 2-oxoglutarate synthase and EC 1.2.7.7, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (ferredoxin).
