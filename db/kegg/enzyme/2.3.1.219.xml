NAME        demethoxycurcumin synthase;
            CURS3
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     4-coumaroyl-CoA:feruloylacetyl-CoA feruloyltransferase (demethoxycurcumin-forming)
REACTION    (1) 4-coumaroyl-CoA + feruloylacetyl-CoA + H2O = 2 CoA + demethoxycurcumin + CO2 [RN:R08809];
            (2) 4-coumaroyl-CoA + (4-coumaroyl)acetyl-CoA + H2O = 2 CoA + bisdemethoxycurcumin + CO2 [RN:R08807]
ALL_REAC    R08807 R08809
SUBSTRATE   4-coumaroyl-CoA [CPD:C00223];
            feruloylacetyl-CoA [CPD:C17741];
            H2O [CPD:C00001];
            (4-coumaroyl)acetyl-CoA [CPD:C17740]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            demethoxycurcumin [CPD:C17742];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            bisdemethoxycurcumin [CPD:C17743]
COMMENT     A polyketide synthase from the plant Curcuma longa (turmeric). Three isoforms exist, CURS1, CURS2 and CURS3. While CURS1 and CURS2 prefer feruloyl-CoA as a starter substrate (cf. EC 2.3.1.217, curcumin synthase), CURS3 can accept 4-coumaroyl-CoA equally well [1].
