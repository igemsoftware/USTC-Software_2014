ENTRY       EC 3.2.1.179                Enzyme
NAME        gellan tetrasaccharide unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase;
            UGL (ambiguous);
            unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Glycosylases;
            Glycosidases, i.e. enzymes that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp hydrolase
REACTION    beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp + H2O = 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate + beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp [RN:R09831]
ALL_REAC    R09831
SUBSTRATE   beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp;
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate [CPD:C04053];
            beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp
COMMENT     The enzyme releases 4-deoxy-4(5)-unsaturated D-glucuronic acid from oligosaccharides produced by polysaccharide lyases, e.g. the tetrasaccharide beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp produced by EC 4.2.2.25, gellan lyase. The enzyme can also hydrolyse unsaturated chondroitin and hyaluronate disaccharides (beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc6S, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp2S-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc), preferring the unsulfated disaccharides to the sulfated disaccharides.
