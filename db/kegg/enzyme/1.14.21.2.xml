NAME        (S)-cheilanthifoline synthase;
            (S)-scoulerine oxidase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated
SYSNAME     (S)-scoulerine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming)
REACTION    (S)-scoulerine + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (S)-cheilanthifoline + NADP+ + 2 H2O [RN:R03834]
ALL_REAC    R03834
SUBSTRATE   (S)-scoulerine [CPD:C02106];

            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (S)-cheilanthifoline [CPD:C05174];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     A heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450) catalysing an oxidative reaction that does not incorporate oxygen into the product. Forms the methylenedioxy bridge of the protoberberine alkaloid cheilanthifoline from oxidative ring closure of adjacent phenolic and methoxy groups of scoulerine.
