SUBSTRATE   polyprenyl diphosphate [CPD:C05847];
            4-hydroxybenzoate [CPD:C00156]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate [CPD:C05848]
COMMENT     This enzyme, involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, attaches a polyprenyl side chain to a 4-hydroxybenzoate ring, producing the first ubiquinone intermediate that is membrane bound. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the side chain varies in different species. The enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency [2,4,5].
