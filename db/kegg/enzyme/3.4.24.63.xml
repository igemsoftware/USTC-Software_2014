ENTRY       EC 3.4.24.63                Enzyme
NAME        meprin B;
            meprin-b
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Metalloendopeptidases
REACTION    Hydrolysis of proteins, including azocasein, and peptides. Hydrolysis of -His5!Leu-, -Leu6!Cys-, -Ala14!Leu- and -Cys19!Gly- bonds in insulin B chain
COMMENT     A brush border membrane-bound metalloendopeptidase known from the intestine of all mouse strains that have been tested, and the kidney of certain inbred strains. A tetramer of meprin beta subunits (in contrast to meprin A, which contains both alpha and beta subunits). Occurs in the kidney as a proenzyme that can be activated by trypsin. Meprin B is inhibited by both EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, but not by phosphoramidon, captopril or thiorphan. In peptidase family M12 (astacin family)
