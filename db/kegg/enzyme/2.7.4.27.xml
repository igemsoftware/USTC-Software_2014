CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring phosphorus-containing groups;
            Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
SYSNAME     [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate:phosphate phosphotransferase
REACTION    [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate + phosphate = [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] + diphosphate
SUBSTRATE   [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate;
            phosphate [CPD:C00009]
PRODUCT     [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase];
