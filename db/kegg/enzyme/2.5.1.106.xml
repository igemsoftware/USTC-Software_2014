SYSNAME     dimethylallyl-diphosphate:brevianamide-F dimethylallyl-C-2-transferase
REACTION    dimethylallyl diphosphate + brevianamide F = diphosphate + tryprostatin B [RN:R10340]
ALL_REAC    R10340
SUBSTRATE   dimethylallyl diphosphate [CPD:C00235];
            brevianamide F [CPD:C20563]
PRODUCT     diphosphate [CPD:C00013];
            tryprostatin B [CPD:C20512]
COMMENT     The enzyme from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus can also prenylate other tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides. Prenylation occurs mainly at C-2 [1], but also at C-3 [2]. Involved in the biosynthetic pathways of several indole alkaloids such as tryprostatins, cyclotryprostatins, spirotryprostatins, fumitremorgins and verruculogen.
