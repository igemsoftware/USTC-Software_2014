NAME        anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     benzoyl-CoA:anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase
REACTION    benzoyl-CoA + anthranilate = CoA + N-benzoylanthranilate [RN:R02453]
ALL_REAC    R02453
SUBSTRATE   benzoyl-CoA [CPD:C00512];

PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            N-benzoylanthranilate [CPD:C03141]
COMMENT     Cinnamoyl-CoA, 4-coumaroyl-CoA and salicyloyl-CoA can act as donors, but more slowly. Involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.
