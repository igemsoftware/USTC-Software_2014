ENTRY       EC 3.4.23.28                Enzyme
NAME        acrocylindropepsin;
            Acrocylindrium proteinase;
            Acrocylindrium acid proteinase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Aspartic endopeptidases
REACTION    Preference for hydrophobic residues at P1 and P1'. Action on the B chain of insulin is generally similar to that of pepsin A, but it also cleaves Leu6!Cys(SO3H), Glu21!Arg and Asn3!Gln, although not Gln4-His
COMMENT     From the imperfect fungus Acrocylindrium sp. Has a very low pH optimum on casein of 2.0. In peptidase family A1 (pepsin A family).
HISTORY     EC 3.4.23.28 created 1992 (EC 3.4.23.6 created 1992 (EC 3.4.23.6 created 1961 as EC 3.4.4.17, transferred 1972 to EC 3.4.23.6, modified 1981 [EC 3.4.23.7, EC 3.4.23.8, EC 3.4.23.9, EC 3.4.23.10, EC 3.4.99.1, EC 3.4.99.15 and EC 3.4.99.25 all created 1972 and incorporated 1978], part incorporated 1992)
