COMMENT     The enzyme is activated by AMP. EC 1.1.1.34, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) is inactivated by the phosphorylation of the enzyme protein. Histones can also act as acceptors. The enzyme can also phosphorylate hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) and adipose hormone-sensitive lipase (EC 3.1.1.79) [5]. Thr-172 within the catalytic subunit (alpha-subunit) is the major site phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase [7]. GTP can act instead of ATP [4]
