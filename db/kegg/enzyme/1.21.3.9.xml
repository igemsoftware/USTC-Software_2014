COMMENT     This enzyme catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by the bacterium Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. The enzyme is a dimeric heme-protein oxidase that catalyses the oxidative dimerization of two L-tryptophan-derived molecules to form dichlorochromopyrrolic acid, the precursor for the fused six-ring indolocarbazole scaffold of rebeccamycin [1]. Contains one molecule of heme b per monomer, as well as non-heme iron that is not part of an iron-sulfur center [2]. The enzyme also possesses catalase activity, suggesting that the secondary product may be hydrogen peroxide rather than water. The nature of the secondary product has not been confirmed as of 2013.
