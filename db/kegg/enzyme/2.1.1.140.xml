ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.140                Enzyme
NAME        (S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (S)-coclaurine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (S)-N-methylcoclaurine [RN:R04692]
ALL_REAC    R04692
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            (S)-coclaurine [CPD:C06161]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            (S)-N-methylcoclaurine [CPD:C05176]
COMMENT     The enzyme is specific for the (S)-isomer of coclaurine. Norcoclaurine can also act as an acceptor.
