ENTRY       EC 1.14.13.47               Enzyme
NAME        (S)-limonene 3-monooxygenase;
            (-)-limonene 3-hydroxylase;
            (-)-limonene 3-monooxygenase;
            (-)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     (S)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)
REACTION    (S)-limonene + NADPH + H+ + O2 = (-)-trans-isopiperitenol + NADP+ + H2O [RN:R02469]
ALL_REAC    R02469
SUBSTRATE   (S)-limonene;
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080];
            O2 [CPD:C00007]
PRODUCT     (-)-trans-isopiperitenol [CPD:C01123];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
COMMENT     High specificity, but NADH can act instead of NADPH, although more slowly. A heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
