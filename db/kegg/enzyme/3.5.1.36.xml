NAME        N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate hydrolase;
            5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate synthase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds;
            In linear amides
SYSNAME     N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate methylamidohydrolase
REACTION    N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate + H2O = 2-oxoglutarate + methylamine [RN:R01587]
