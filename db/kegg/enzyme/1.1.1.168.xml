ENTRY       EC 1.1.1.168                Enzyme
NAME        2-dehydropantolactone reductase (Re-specific);
            2-oxopantoyl lactone reductase;
            ketopantoyl lactone reductase;
            2-ketopantoyl lactone reductase;
            2-dehydropantoyl-lactone reductase (A-specific);
            (R)-pantolactone:NADP+ oxidoreductase (A-specific);
            2-dehydropantolactone reductase (A-specific)
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-OH group of donors;
            With NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor
SYSNAME     (R)-pantolactone:NADP+ oxidoreductase (Re-specific)
REACTION    (R)-pantolactone + NADP+ = 2-dehydropantolactone + NADPH + H+ [RN:R03155]
ALL_REAC    R03155
SUBSTRATE   (R)-pantolactone [CPD:C01012];
            NADP+ [CPD:C00006]
PRODUCT     2-dehydropantolactone [CPD:C01125];
            NADPH [CPD:C00005];
            H+ [CPD:C00080]
COMMENT     The yeast enzyme differs from that from Escherichia coli [EC 1.1.1.214 2-dehydropantolactone reductase (Si-specific)], which is specific for the Si-face of NADP+, and in receptor requirements from EC 1.1.99.26 3-hydroxycyclohexanone dehydrogenase.
