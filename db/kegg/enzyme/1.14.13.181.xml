NAME        13-deoxydaunorubicin hydroxylase;
            DoxA
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen;
            With NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor
SYSNAME     13-deoxydaunorubicin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (13-hydroxylating)

COMMENT     The enzymes from the Gram-positive bacteria Streptomyces sp. C5 and Streptomyces peucetius show broad substrate specificity for structures based on an anthracycline aglycone, but have a strong preference for 4-methoxy anthracycline intermediates (13-deoxydaunorubicin and 13-dihydrodaunorubicin) over their 4-hydroxy analogues (13-deoxycarminomycin and 13-dihydrocarminomycin), as well as a preference for substrates hydroxylated at the C-13 rather than the C-14 position.
