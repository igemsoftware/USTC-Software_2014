            Hydrolysing N-glycosyl compounds
SYSNAME     rRNA N-glycohydrolase
REACTION    Hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond at A-4324 in 28S rRNA from rat ribosomes
COMMENT     Ricin A-chain and related toxins show this activity. Naked rRNA is attacked more slowly than rRNA in intact ribosomes. Naked rRNA from Escherichia coli is cleaved at a corresponding position.
