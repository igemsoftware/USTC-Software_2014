NAME        phloroisovalerophenone synthase;
            valerophenone synthase;
            3-methyl-1-(trihydroxyphenyl)butan-1-one synthase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     isovaleryl-CoA:malonyl-CoA acyltransferase
REACTION    isovaleryl-CoA + 3 malonyl-CoA = 4 CoA + 3 CO2 + 3-methyl-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)butan-1-one [RN:R05331]
ALL_REAC    R05331
SUBSTRATE   isovaleryl-CoA [CPD:C02939];
            malonyl-CoA [CPD:C00083]
PRODUCT     CoA [CPD:C00010];
            CO2 [CPD:C00011];
            3-methyl-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)butan-1-one [CPD:C07350]
COMMENT     Closely related to EC 2.3.1.74, naringenin-chalcone synthase. The product, 3-methyl-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)butan-1-one, is phloroisovalerophenone. Also acts on isobutyryl-CoA as substrate to give phlorisobutyrophenone. The products are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the bitter (alpha) acids in hops (Humulus lupulus).
