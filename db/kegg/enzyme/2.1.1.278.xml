ENTRY       EC 2.1.1.278                Enzyme
NAME        indole-3-acetate O-methyltransferase;
            IAA carboxylmethyltransferase;
            IAMT
CLASS       Transferases;
            Transferring one-carbon groups;
            Methyltransferases
SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(indol-3-yl)acetate O-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (indol-3-yl)acetate = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methyl (indol-3-yl)acetate [RN:R10452]
ALL_REAC    R10452
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            (indol-3-yl)acetate [CPD:C00954]
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            methyl (indol-3-yl)acetate [CPD:C20635]
COMMENT     Binds Mg2+. The enzyme is found in plants and is important for regulation of the plant hormone (indol-3-yl)acetate. The product, methyl (indol-3-yl)acetate is inactive as hormone [2].
